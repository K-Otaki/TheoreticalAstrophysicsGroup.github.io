{"title":"第3回目東アジアAGNワークショップ【日本語】","text":"<p>This is the third of a series of workshops for getting together scientists working in the East-Asia region in the AGN field. The previous two workshops, held respectively in Jeju, Korea in September 2012 and in Sapporo, Japan in August 2013, were very successful. These workshops provided a lively, stimulating forum for presenting and discussing new results, as well as exchanging ideas, which cover a wide range of topics in AGN research, including both theoretical modeling and observational investigation in multiple wavebands.</p>\n \n<p>The ultimate aim of this series of workshops is to foster existing collaborations, and to initiate new ones, among AGN researchers in East Asia countries. Thanks to the short distances within only several hours flight among these countries, there is great and promising potential of fruitful collaborations. Starting and fostering collaborative activities at the current stage is especially important as we are entering an exciting era of the advent of large international facilities, including ALMA, Astro-H, TMT and GMT. Motivated by feedbacks from the participants of the previous workshops, this workshop will put special emphasis on encouraging and initiating new collaborations. </p>\n","tags":"","url":"/conferences/abroad/ja/2015/01/28/eaagnw-2015/"},
