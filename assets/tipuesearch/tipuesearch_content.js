{"title":"Density scratches and formation processes of primordial dark matter haloes via dry mergers【日本語】","text":"<p>銀河の衝突・合体は，階層的構造形成理論において普遍的なものである。我々はそれらが銀河の形成・進化に与える影響について，N体シミュレー ションを用いて調べている。本セミナーでは最近得られた2つの結果について紹介する。\n1. 衝突する2つの系の間に質量比がある場合，小さな系(satellite)は力学摩擦によって軌道エネルギーや角運動量を失い，大きな系(host)の中 心部へと沈み込む。力学摩擦はChandrasekhar (1943)により導出された，基本的でかつ重要な物理過程である。Chandrasekharによると，satelliteの後ろ側にはhost内の粒 子の轍が形成されるはずであるが，これを数値シミュレーションによって直接示した例は数えるほどしかない。我々はN体シミュレーションによ り，hostの力学応答には轍だけでなく軸対称な成分も存在することを示す。さらにはそれらを再現する理論モデルを構築し，近傍の銀河に適用 した。\n2. Ishiyama (2014)は宇宙論的N体シミュレーションにより，コールドダークマター粒子の質量から期待される最小質量スケールのダークマターハローの形成・進化を 調べた。それによると，最小スケール付近のダークマターハローの中心部の密度カスプはNavarro-Frenk-Whiteモデルよりも鋭 く，成長とともに緩くなる。我々はN体シミュレーションを用いて，衝突・合体が最小スケール付近のダークマターハローの進化に与える影響を調 べ，Ishiyama (2014)の結果に理解を与える結果を得た。</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"DM Halo\", \"N-body simulation\", \"structure formation\"]","url":"/seminars/ja/2015/10/02/ogiya/"},
{"title":"What young stars' infrared variability reveals about protoplanetary disks【English】","text":"<p>\nYoung stars' infrared emission shows several puzzling features: variability uncorrelated with visible-light changes, foreground extinction that recurs erratically on weekly timescales, and excesses over the stellar photosphere too large to explain with starlight absorbed and re-emitted by a hydrostatic protostellar disk.  I will discuss how each of these features can be explained by a time-varying, magnetically-supported disk atmosphere like those found in MHD calculations of magneto-rotational turbulence.  Through Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations I will show that such an atmosphere yields variability amplitudes as observed.  Since the starlight-absorbing surface lies higher than in hydrostatic models, a greater fraction of the stellar luminosity is reprocessed into the infrared, providing a natural explanation for the larger excesses. The atmosphere rises high enough to obscure the star in systems viewed near edge-on, and can explain the week-long extinction events, provided only that the dust in the outer parts of the disk has undergone some growth or settling, as likely required for planet formation to begin.</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"protoplanetary discs\", \"MHD\"]","url":"/seminars/en/2015/10/06/turner/"},

{"title":"A New Stellar Population in the Bulge, and a new survey【English】","text":"<p>\nBy mass, the Galactic bulge is actually dominated by a relatively metal rich bar.  This population exhibits relatively rapid rotation that reflects a pattern speed independent of Galactic latitude. We have completed a survey of 955 RR Lyrae stars in the bulge region, and find a remarkable population that does not rotate and exhibits one of the highest velocity dispersions known in the Galaxy.  Although one might infer these stars to be halo members, they are metal rich, yet alpha element enhanced.   We consider what the nature of this unusual population might be, from early merger to early starburst remnant.   I will also present data from a new 28-inch telescope that is optimized to image at low surface brightness.  The HERON project (Halos and Environments of Nearby Galaxies) discovers extended stellar distributions that range from exhibiting clear interactions to regular and undisturbed.  I will present observations from this project that is in progress, and discuss possible theoretical investigations.</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"galaxy formation\", \"observations\"]","url":"/seminars/en/2016/03/11/rich/"},

{"title":"Fragmentation in self-gravitating accretion disks; Influence of binary systems【English】","text":"<p>Self-gravitation can play a role in protoplanetary- and AGN-disks. If they are massive enough, gravitoturbulence sets in and acts as a strong driver for angular momentum redistribution. Thereby it moves large amounts of gas from the outer parts of the disk to the central object. However, if the disk cools too fast its gas will fragment into bound objects, i.e. stars or planets, which alter the accretion in the following.\nThe detailed circumstances, which lead to fragmentation are not fully understood. Different codes show different behavior in terms of fragmentation for ever higher resolutions and the same physical setup. We show that especially the shock handling can have a strong influence on the outcome of these kind of simulations. At the same time the physical quantities like external irradiation and torques, or the composition of the gas have an influence on the gravitoturbulent state. Here, we want to focus on massive circumbinary disks and discuss how they might alter fragmentation in self-gravitating disks.</p>\n\n","tags":"[\"accretion discs\", \"computational fluid dynamics\", \"numerical simulations\"]","url":"/seminars/en/2018/08/01/klee/"},
