abstract: We investigate the UV-optical (longward of Lyalpha 1216 Å) spectral variability
  of nearly 9000 quasars (0 < z < 4) using multi-epoch photometric data within the
  SDSS Stripe 82 region. The regression slope in the flux-flux space of a quasar light
  curve directly measures the color of the flux difference spectrum, then the spectral
  shape of the flux difference spectra can be derived by taking a careful look at
  the redshift dependence of the regression slopes. First, we confirm that the observed
  quasar spectrum becomes bluer when the quasar becomes brighter. We infer the spectral
  index of the composite difference spectrum as α_{ν}^{dif}∼+1/3 (in the form of f_{ν}∝ν^{α_{ν}}),
  which is significantly bluer than that of the composite spectrum α_{ν}^{com}∼-0.5.
  We also show that the continuum variability cannot be explained by accretion disk
  models with varying mass accretion rates. Second, we examine the effects of broad
  emission line variability on the color-redshift space. The variability of the "Small
  Blue Bump" is extensively discussed. We show that the low-ionization lines of Mg
  II and Fe II are less variable compared to Balmer emission lines and high-ionization
  lines, and the Balmer continuum is the dominant variable source around ~3000 Å.
  These results are compared with previous studies, and the physical mechanisms of
  the variability of the continuum and emission lines are discussed.
