abstract: 'Based on the physical model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth
  via gas accretion in a circumnuclear disk (CND) proposed by Kawakatu & Wada, we
  describe the formation of high-z (z>6) quasars (QSOs) whose BH masses are M BH>109
  M sun. We derive the necessary conditions to form QSOs at z>6 by only gas accretion:
  (1) a large mass supply with M sup>1010 M sunfrom host galaxies to CNDs, because
  the final BH mass is only 1%-10% of the total supplied mass from QSO hosts. (2)
  High star formation efficiency for a rapid BH growth which is comparable to high-z
  starburst galaxies such as submillimeter galaxies. We also find that if the BH growth
  is limited by the Eddington accretion, the final BH mass is greatly suppressed when
  the period of mass supply from hosts, t sup, is shorter than the Eddington timescale.
  Thus, the super-Eddington growth is required for the QSO formation while t sup,
  which is determined by the efficiency of angular momentum transfer, is shorter than
  ~108 yr. The evolution of the QSO luminosity depends on the redshift z i at which
  accretion onto a seed BH is initiated. In other words, the brighter QSOs at z>6
  favor the late growth of SMBHs (i.e., z i ≈ 10) rather than early growth (i.e.,
  z i ≈ 30). For z i ≈ 10, t sup sime 108 yr is shorter than that of the star formation
  in the CND. Thus, the gas in the CND can accrete onto a BH more efficiently, compared
  with the case for z i ≈ 30 (or t sup ≈ 109 yr). Moreover, we predict the observable
  properties and the evolution of QSOs at z>6. In a QSO phase, there should exist
  a stellar rich massive CND, whose gas mass is about 10% of the dynamical mass inside
  ~0.1-1 kpc. On the other hand, in a phase where the BH grows (i.e., a proto-QSO
  phase), the proto-QSO has a gas-rich massive CND whose gas mass is comparable to
  the dynamical mass. Compared with the observed properties of the distant QSO SDSS
  J1148+5251 observed at z = 6.42, we predict that SDSS J1148+5251 corresponds to
  the scenario of the late growth of SMBH with z i ~ 10, which is accompanied by a
  massive CNDs with M g ≈ 5 × 1010 M sun and the luminous nuclear starburst L SBat
  infrared band with L SB ≈ 1047 erg s-1. Moreover, we predict that the progenitor
  of SDSS J1148+5251 can be the super-Eddington object. These predictions can be verified
  by ALMA, SPICA, and JWST.'
