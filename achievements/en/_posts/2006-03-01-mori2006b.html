abstract: We simulate the dynamical and chemical evolution of a forming galaxy embedded
  in a dark matter halo, using a three-dimensional N-body/hydrodynamic simulation
  code combined with stellar population synthesis. We find that a sparkling phase
  with multitudinous SN explosions at less than 3 Ã— 10 8 years exhibits intense Lyman
  alpha emission from cooling shocks and well resembles Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs)
  that have been recently discovered at redshifts greater than three. Subsequently,
  the galaxy shifts to a stellar continuum radiation-dominated phase within 10 9 years,
  which appears like Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). At the LAE phase the abundance of
  heavy elements is subsolar and shows strong spatial variance, but it convergently
  reaches a level of solar abundance at the LBG phase. Hence, it turns out that LAEs
  and LBGs are the on-going and major phases of chemical enrichment in a galaxy.
