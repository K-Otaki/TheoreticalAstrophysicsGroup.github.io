abstract: We investigate the formation and evolution of satellite galaxies using smoothed
  particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of a Milky Way (MW) like system, focusing
  on the best resolved examples, analogous to the classical MW satellites. Comparing
  with a pure dark matter simulation, we find that the condensation of baryons has
  had a relatively minor effect on the structure of the satellites' dark matter haloes.
  The stellar mass that forms in each satellite agrees relatively well over three
  levels of resolution (a factor of ˜64 in particle mass) and scales with (sub)halo
  mass in a similar way in an independent semi-analytical model. Our model provides
  a relatively good match to the average luminosity function of the MW and M31. To
  establish whether the potential wells of our satellites are realistic, we measure
  their masses within observationally determined half-light radii, finding that they
  have somewhat higher mass-to-light ratios than those derived for the MW dSphs from
  stellar kinematic data; the most massive examples are most discrepant. A statistical
  test yields an ˜6 per cent probability that the simulated and observationally derived
  distributions of masses are consistent. If the satellite population of the MW is
  typical, our results could imply that feedback processes not properly captured by
  our simulations have reduced the central densities of subhaloes, or that they initially
  formed with lower concentrations, as would be the case, for example, if the dark
  matter were made of warm, rather than cold particles.
