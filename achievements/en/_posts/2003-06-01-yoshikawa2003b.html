abstract: We present velocity statistics of galaxies and their biases inferred from
  the statistics of the underlying dark matter using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation
  of galaxy formation in low-density and spatially flat (Omega0=0.3 and lambda0=0.7)
  cold dark matter cosmogony. Our simulation is based on a particle-particle-particle-mesh
  (P3M) N-body Poisson solver and smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Galaxies in our
  simulation are identified as clumps of cold and dense gas particles and classified
  as young and old galaxies according to their formation epochs. We find that the
  pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) of all galaxies is significantly lower than that
  of the dark matter particles and that the PVD of the young galaxies is lower than
  that of the old types, and even of all galaxies together, especially at small separations.
  These results are in reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of PVDs in
  the Las Campanas redshift survey, the IRAS Point Source Catalogue Redshift Survey,
  and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We also find that the low PVD of young galaxies
  is due to the effects of dynamical friction as well as the different spatial distribution,
  while the difference in the PVD between all galaxies and dark matter can be mostly
  ascribed to their different spatial distributions. We also consider the mean infall
  velocity and the POTENT density reconstruction that are often used to measure the
  cosmological parameters, and investigate the effects of spatial bias and dynamical
  friction. In our simulation, the mean infall velocity of young galaxies is significantly
  lower than that of all the galaxies or of the old galaxies, and the dynamical bias
  becomes important on scales less than 3h-1Mpc. The mass density field reconstructed
  from the velocity field of young galaxies using the POTENT-style method suffers
  in accuracy from both the spatial bias and the dynamical friction on the smoothing
  scale of Rs=8h-1Mpc. On the other hand, in the case of Rs=12h-1Mpc, which is typically
  adopted in the actual POTENT analysis, the density reconstruction based on various
  tracers of galaxies is reasonably accurate. We also analyze the motions of central
  galaxies and the velocity dispersion of galaxies within halos and discuss their
  implications for the motion of cD galaxies and the determination of the mass of
  galaxy groups.
