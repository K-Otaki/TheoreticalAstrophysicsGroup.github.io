abstract: We explore the possibility of subsequent star formation after a first star
  forms in a Population III object, by focusing on the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD)
  feedback caused by ionizing photons, as well as H2-dissociating photons. For this
  purpose, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations in which the radiative transfer
  of ionizing photons and H2-dissociating photons from a first star is self-consistently
  coupled with hydrodynamics based on a smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. It
  is shown that density peaks above a threshold density can keep collapsing, owing
  to the shielding of H2-dissociating radiation by an H2 shell formed ahead of a D-type
  ionization front. But, below the threshold density an M-type ionization front with
  a shock propagates, and density peaks are radiation-hydrodynamically evaporated
  by the shock. The threshold density depends on the distance from the source star
  and is ~102 cm-3 for a source distance of 30 pc. Taking into consideration that
  the extent of a Population III object is ~100 pc and the density peaks within it
  have densities of 102-104 cm-3, it is concluded that secondary star formation is
  possible in the broad regions of a Population III object.
