abstract: 'To explain the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SED) of Seyfert
  nuclei and QSOs, we study the emission spectrum emerging from a vertical disk-corona
  structure composed of a two-temperature plasma by solving hydrostatic equilibrium
  and radiative transfer self-consistently. Our model can nicely reproduce the soft
  X-ray excess with alpha ( Lnu ∝ nu- alpha) of about 1.5 and the hard tail extending
  to ˜50 keV with alpha˜0.5. The different spectral slopes ( alpha˜1.5 below 2 keV
  and ˜0.5 above) are the results of different emission mechanisms: unsaturated Comptonization
  in the former and a combination of Comptonization, bremsstrahlung, and reflection
  of the coronal radiation at the disk-corona boundary in the latter.'
