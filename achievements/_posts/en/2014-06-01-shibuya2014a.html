abstract: We present a statistical study of velocities of Lyalpha, interstellar (IS)
  absorption, and nebular lines and gas covering fraction for Lyalpha emitters (LAEs)
  at z ~= 2. We make a sample of 22 LAEs with a large Lyalpha equivalent width (EW)
  of >~ 50 Å based on our deep Keck/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) observations,
  in conjunction with spectroscopic data from the Subaru/Fiber Multi Object Spectrograph
  program and the literature. We estimate the average velocity offset of Lyalpha from
  a systemic redshift determined with nebular lines to be Deltav Lyalpha = 234 $\pm$
  9 km s-1. Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we confirm the previous claim of Hashimoto
  et al. that the average Deltav Lyalpha of LAEs is smaller than that of Lyman break
  galaxies (LBGs). Our LRIS data successfully identify blueshifted multiple IS absorption
  lines in the UV continua of four LAEs on an individual basis. The average velocity
  offset of IS absorption lines from a systemic redshift is Deltav IS = 204 $\pm$
  27 km s-1, indicating LAEs' gas outflow with a velocity comparable to typical LBGs.
  Thus, the ratio  R^Lyα_IS ≡Δv_Lyα/Δv_IS of LAEs is around unity, suggestive of low
  impacts on Lyalpha transmission by resonant scattering of neutral hydrogen in the
  IS medium. We find an anti-correlation between Lyalpha EW and the covering fraction,
  fc , estimated from the depth of absorption lines, where fc is an indicator of average
  neutral hydrogen column density, N H I . The results of our study support the idea
  that N H I  is a key quantity determining Lyalpha emissivity.  Based on data obtained
  with the Subaru Telescope operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.
