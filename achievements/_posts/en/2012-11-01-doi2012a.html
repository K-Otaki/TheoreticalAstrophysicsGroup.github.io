abstract: We report the finding of kiloparsec (kpc)-scale radio structures in three
  radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies from the Faint Images of the Radio
  Sky at Twenty-centimeters of the Very Large Array, which increases the number of
  known radio-loud NLS1s with kpc-scale structures to six, including two gamma-ray-emitting
  NLS1s (PMN J0948+0022 and 1H 0323+342) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
  The detection rate of extended radio emissions in NLS1s is lower than that in broad-line
  active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a statistical significance. We found both core-dominated
  (blazar-like) and lobe-dominated (radio-galaxy-like) radio structures in these six
  NLS1s, which can be understood in the framework of the unified scheme of radio-loud
  AGNs that considers radio galaxies as non-beamed parent populations of blazars.
  Five of the six NLS1s have (1) extended radio luminosities suggesting jet kinetic
  powers of >~ 1044 erg s-1, which is sufficient to make jets escape from hosts' dense
  environments; (2) black holes of >~ 107 M &sun;, which can generate the necessary
  jet powers from near-Eddington mass accretion; and (3) two-sided radio structures
  at kpc scales, requiring expansion rates of ~0.01c-0.3c and kinematic ages of >~
  107 years. On the other hand, most typical NLS1s would be driven by black holes
  of <~ 107 M &sun; in a limited lifetime of ~107 years. Hence, the kpc-scale radio
  structures may originate in a small window of opportunity during the final stage
  of the NLS1 phase just before growing into broad-line AGNs.
