abstract: We present results from a series of cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics
  (SPH) simulations coupled with the particle-particle-particle-mesh solver for the
  gravitational force. The simulations are designed to predict the statistical properties
  of X-ray clusters of galaxies as well as to study the formation of galaxies. We
  have seven simulation runs with different assumptions about the thermal state of
  the intracluster gas. Following the recent work by Pearce and coworkers, we modify
  our SPH algorithm so as to phenomenologically incorporate galaxy formation by decoupling
  the cooled gas particles from the hot gas particles. All the simulations employ
  1283 particles both for dark matter and for gas components and thus constitute the
  largest systematic catalogs of clusters simulated in the SPH method performed so
  far. These enable us to compare the analytical predictions about statistical properties
  of X-ray clusters against our direct simulation results in an unbiased manner. We
  find that the luminosities of the simulated clusters are quite sensitive to the
  thermal history and also to the numerical resolution of the simulations and thus
  are not reliable. On the other hand, the mass-temperature relation for the simulated
  clusters is fairly insensitive to the assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster
  gas, is robust against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with the
  analytic prediction. Therefore, prediction of the X-ray temperature functions of
  clusters on the basis of the Press-Schechter mass function and the virial equilibrium
  is fairly reliable.
