abstract: Rapid fluctuation with a frequency dependence of 1/falpha (with alpha =~
  1-2) is characteristic of radiation from black-hole objects. Its origin remains
  poorly understood. We examined three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulation
  data, finding that a magnetized accretion disk exhibits both 1/falpha fluctuation
  (with alpha =~ 2) and a fractal magnetic structure (with the fractal dimension of
  D ~ 1.9). The fractal field configuration leads to reconnection events with a variety
  of released energy and duration, thereby producing 1/falpha fluctuations.
