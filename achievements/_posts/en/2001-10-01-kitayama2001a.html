abstract: We explore possibilities of collapse and star formation in Population III
  objects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation. Assuming
  spherical symmetry, we solve self-consistently radiative transfer of photons, non-equilibrium
  H2 chemistry and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB does suppress the formation
  of low-mass objects, the negative feedback turns out to be weaker than previously
  suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of collapse drops significantly below
  the virial temperature Tvir~104K at weak UV intensities (J21<~10-2), owing to both
  self-shielding of the gas and H2 cooling. Clouds above this cut-off tend to contract
  highly dynamically, further promoting self-shielding and H2 formation. For plausible
  radiation intensities and spectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures
  well below 104K before rotationally supported and the final H2 fraction reaches
  ~10-3.  Our results imply that star formation can take place in low-mass objects
  collapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is ~109Msolar
  for clouds collapsing at redshifts z<~3, but drops significantly at higher redshifts.
  In a conventional cold dark matter universe, the latter coincides roughly with that
  of the 1sigma density fluctuations. Objects near and above this threshold can thus
  constitute `building blocks' of luminous structures, and we discuss their links
  to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical galaxies and faint blue objects. These results suggest
  that the UVB can play a key role in regulating the star formation history of the
  Universe.
