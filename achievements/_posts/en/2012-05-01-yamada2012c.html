abstract: We present the results of the observations of the Lyalpha line profiles
  of 91 emission-line galaxies at z = 3.1 with a spectral resolution of lambda/deltalambda(FWHM)
  â‰ˆ1700 or 180 km s-1. A significant fraction of ~50% of the observed objects show
  the characteristic double peaks in their Lyalpha profile. The red peak is much stronger
  than the blue one for most of the cases. The red peaks themselves also show weak
  but significant asymmetry and their widths are correlated with the velocity separation
  of the red and the blue peaks. This implies that the peaks are not isolated multiple
  components with different velocities but parts of a single line that are modified
  by the absorption and/or scattering by the associated neutral hydrogen gas. The
  characteristic profile can be naturally explained by scattering in the expanding
  shell of the neutral hydrogen surrounding the Lyalpha emitting region while the
  attenuation by the intergalactic medium should also be considered. Our results suggest
  that the star formation in these Lyalpha emitters are dominated by young burst-like
  events that produce the intrinsic Lyalpha emission as well as the gas outflow.
