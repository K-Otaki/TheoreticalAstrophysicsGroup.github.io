abstract: We have performed N-body simulations of globular clusters (GCs) in order
  to estimate a detection rate of mergers of binary stellar mass black holes (BBHs)
  by means of gravitational wave (GW) observatories. For our estimate, we have only
  considered mergers of BBHs which escape from GCs (BBH escapers). BBH escapers merge
  more quickly than BBHs inside GCs because of their small semimajor axes. N-body
  simulation cannot deal with a GC with the number of stars N ˜ 106 due to its high
  calculation cost. We have simulated dynamical evolution of small N clusters (104
  ≲ N ≲ 105), and have extrapolated our simulation results to large N clusters. From
  our simulation results, we have found the following dependence of BBH properties
  on N. BBHs escape from a cluster at each two-body relaxation time at a rate proportional
  to N. Semimajor axes of BBH escapers are inversely proportional to N, if initial
  mass densities of clusters are fixed. Eccentricities, primary masses and mass ratios
  of BBH escapers are independent of N. Using this dependence of BBH properties, we
  have artificially generated a population of BBH escapers from a GC with N ˜ 106,
  and have estimated a detection rate of mergers of BBH escapers by next-generation
  GW observatories. We have assumed that all the GCs are formed 10 or 12 Gyr ago with
  their initial numbers of stars Ni = 5 × 105-2 × 106 and their initial stellar mass
  densities inside their half-mass radii rhoh,i = 6 × 103-106 M&sun; pc-3. Then, the
  detection rate of BBH escapers is 0.5-20 yr-1 for a BH retention fraction RBH =
  0.5. A few BBH escapers are components of hierarchical triple systems, although
  we do not consider secular perturbation on such BBH escapers for our estimate. Our
  simulations have shown that BHs are still inside some of GCs at the present day.
  These BHs may marginally contribute to BBH detection.
