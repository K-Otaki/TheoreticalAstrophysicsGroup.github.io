abstract: A novel mechanism to build up a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is proposed.  Here,
  relativistic radiation-hydrodynamic processes are considered from a galactic scale
  to a horizon scale.  In the present scenario, the mass of a SMBH is predicted to
  be in proportion to the bulge mass, and it turns out that the SMBH-to-bulge mass
  ratio is basically determined by the nuclear energy conversion efficiency from hydrogen
  to helium, var Îµ = 0.007. The BH hierarchy is also addressed in relation to the
  BH formation in globular clusters. Futhermore, a new picture for QSO formation is
  proposed based on the present SMBH formation scenario. It is predicted that a host
  luminosity-dominant ``proto-QSO phase'' exists before the QSO phase, and the proto-QSO
  phase is preceded by an optically-thick ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) phase.
