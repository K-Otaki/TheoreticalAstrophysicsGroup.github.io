abstract: We have developed a numerical software library for collisionless N-body
  simulations named "Phantom-GRAPE" which highly accelerates force calculations among
  particles by use of a new SIMD instruction set extension to the x86 architecture,
  Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX), an enhanced version of the Streaming SIMD Extensions
  (SSE). In our library, not only the Newton's forces, but also central forces with
  an arbitrary shape f(r), which has a finite cutoff radius rcut (i.e. f(r)=0 at r>rcut),
  can be quickly computed. In computing such central forces with an arbitrary force
  shape f(r), we refer to a pre-calculated look-up table. We also present a new scheme
  to create the look-up table whose binning is optimal to keep good accuracy in computing
  forces and whose size is small enough to avoid cache misses. Using an Intel Core
  i7-2600 processor, we measure the performance of our library for both of the Newton's
  forces and the arbitrarily shaped central forces. In the case of Newton's forces,
  we achieve 2×109 interactions per second with one processor core (or 75 GFLOPS if
  we count 38 operations per interaction), which is 20 times higher than the performance
  of an implementation without any explicit use of SIMD instructions, and 2 times
  than that with the SSE instructions. With four processor cores, we obtain the performance
  of 8×109 interactions per second (or 300 GFLOPS). In the case of the arbitrarily
  shaped central forces, we can calculate 1×109 and 4×109 interactions per second
  with one and four processor cores, respectively. The performance with one processor
  core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of the implementations without any
  use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE instructions. These performances depend
  only weakly on the number of particles, irrespective of the force shape. It is good
  contrast with the fact that the performance of force calculations accelerated by
  graphics processing units (GPUs) depends strongly on the number of particles. Substantially
  weak dependence of the performance on the number of particles is suitable to collisionless
  N-body simulations, since these simulations are usually performed with sophisticated
  N-body solvers such as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined with an individual timestep
  scheme. We conclude that collisionless N-body simulations accelerated with our library
  have significant advantage over those accelerated by GPUs, especially on massively
  parallel environments.
