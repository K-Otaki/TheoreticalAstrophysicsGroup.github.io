abstract: 'We investigate the evolution of angular momentum in smoothed particle hydrodynamic
  (SPH) simulations of galaxy formation, paying particular attention to artificial
  numerical effects. We find that a cold gas disc forming in an ambient hot gas halo
  receives a strong hydrodynamic torque from the hot gas. By splitting the hydrodynamic
  force into artificial viscosity and pressure gradients, we find that the angular
  momentum transport is caused not by the artificial viscosity but by the pressure
  gradients. Using simple test simulations of shear flows, we conclude that the pressure
  gradient-based viscosity can be divided into two components: one due to the noisiness
  of SPH and the other due to ram pressure. The former is problematic even with very
  high resolution, because increasing the resolution does not reduce the noisiness.
  On the other hand, the ram pressure effect appears only when a cold gas disc or
  sheet does not contain enough particles. In such a case, holes form in the disc
  or sheet, and then ram pressure from intra-hole hot gas causes significant deceleration.
  In simulations of galactic disc formation, star formation usually decreases the
  number of cold gas particles, and hole formation leads to the fragmentation of the
  disc. This fragmentation not only induces further angular momentum transport, but
  also affects star formation in the disc. To circumvent these problems, we modify
  the SPH algorithm, decoupling the cold gas phases from the hot ones, i.e. inhibiting
  the hydrodynamic interaction between cold and hot particles. This, a crude modelling
  of a multiphase fluid in SPH cosmological simulations, leads to the formation of
  smooth extended cold gas discs and to better numerical convergence. The decoupling
  is applicable in so far as the self-gravitating gas disc with negligible external
  pressure is a good approximation for a cold gas disc.'
