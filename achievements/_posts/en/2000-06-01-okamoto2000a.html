abstract: Using cosmological N-body simulations of critical (SCDM) and open (Omega
  = 0.3, OCDM) cold dark matter models, we investigated the evolution of cluster galaxies.
  Based on our numerical simulation, we constructed merging history trees of the galaxies.
  By following their merging history, we could show that the major merger fractions
  of the galaxies in cluster-forming regions is roughly proportional to (1+z)4.5 at
  low redshifts (z < 2), and has a steep peak at z =~ 2.5 and z =~ 3 in SCDM and OCDM,
  respectively. We also show that the cluster galaxies are affected by the tidal interaction
  after the clusters are formed. Because the formation redshift of the cluster in
  SCDM, z_form = 0.15, is much more recent than that of the cluster in OCDM, z_form
  = 1.6, the cluster galaxies in SCDM show more rapid evolution by tidal interactions
  from z = 0.5 than those in OCDM.
