abstract: In this paper, we describe the implementation and performance of GreeM,
  a massively parallel TreePM code for large-scale cosmological N -body simulations.
  GreeM uses a recursive multi-section algorithm for domain decomposition. The size
  of the domains are adjusted so that the total calculation time of the force becomes
  the same for all processes. The loss of performance due to non-optimal load balancing
  is around 4%, even for more than 10³ CPU cores. GreeM runs efficiently on PC clusters
  and massively-parallel computers, such as a Cray XT4. The measured calculation speed
  on Cray XT4 is 5 × 104 particles per second per CPU core, for the case of an opening
  angle of theta = 0.5, if the number of particles per CPU core is larger than 106.
