abstract: We propose a new evolutionary model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
  and a circumnuclear disk (CND), taking into account the mass supply from a host
  galaxy and the physical states of the CND. In the model, two distinct accretion
  modes depending on the gravitational stability of the CND play a key role in accreting
  gas to a SMBH. (i) If the CND is gravitationally unstable, energy feedback from
  supernovae supports a geometrically thick, turbulent gas disk. The accretion in
  this mode is dominated by turbulent viscosity, and it is significantly larger than
  that in mode (ii), i.e., the CND is supported by gas pressure. Once the gas supply
  from the host is stopped, the high-accretion phase (~0.01-0.1 Msolar yr-1) changes
  to the low one (mode [ii], ~10-4 Msolar yr-1), but there is a delay of ~108 yr.
  Through this evolution, the gas-rich CND turns into the gas-poor stellar disk. We
  found that not all the gas supplied from the host galaxy to the central 100 pc region
  accretes onto the SMBH even in the high-accretion phase (mode [i]), because part
  of the gas is used to form stars. Outflow from the circumnuclear region also suppresses
  the growth of the SMBH. As a result, the final SMBH mass (MBH,final) is not proportional
  to the total gas mass supplied from the host galaxy (Msup); MBH,final/Msup decreases
  with Msup. This would indicate that it is difficult to form a SMBH with ~109 Msolar
  observed for high-z quasi-stellar objects. The evolution of the SMBH and CND would
  be related to the evolutionary tracks of different types of AGNs. We find that the
  AGN luminosity tightly correlates with the luminosity of the nuclear starburst only
  in the high-accretion phase (mode [ii]). This implies that the AGN-starburst connection
  depends on the evolution of the AGN activity.
