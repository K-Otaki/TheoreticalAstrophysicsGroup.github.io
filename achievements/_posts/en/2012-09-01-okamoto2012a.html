abstract: Bulges can be classified into classical and pseudobulges; the former are
  considered to be end products of galactic mergers and the latter to form via secular
  evolution of galactic disks. Observationally, bulges of disk galaxies are mostly
  pseudobulges, including the Milky Way's. We here show, by using self-consistent
  cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, that the formation of pseudobulges
  of Milky Way-sized disk galaxies has mostly completed before disk formation; thus
  the main channel of pseudobulge formation is not secular evolution of disks. Our
  pseudobulges form by rapid gas supply at high-redshift and their progenitors would
  be observed as high-redshift disks.
