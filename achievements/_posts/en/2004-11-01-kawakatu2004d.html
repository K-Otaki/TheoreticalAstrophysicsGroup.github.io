abstract: The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) physically
  linked with bulges are considered. We focus on the radiation hydrodynamic process
  for the growth of SMBH in the optically thick starburst phase, where radiation from
  bulge stars drives the mass accretion on to a galactic center through radiation
  drag effect. In the present scenario, the AGN luminosity-dominant phase (QSO phase)
  is preceded by the host luminosity-dominat phase, which is called `proto-QSO phase'.
  In this phase, there exists the massive dusty disks within younger bulges. Also,
  the proto-QSO phase is anticipated by an optically-thick ultraluminous infrared
  galaxy (ULIRG) phase. Furthermore, such radiation hydrodynamic model has been also
  applied to disk galaxies. It turns out that the mass of a SMBH primarily correlates
  with a bulge component even in a disk galaxy. Thus, by analogy to proto-QSOs, the
  BH growing phase in disk galaxies may have massive dusty disks within younger bulges.
