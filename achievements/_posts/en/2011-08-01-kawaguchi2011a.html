abstract: According to recent models, the accretion disk and black hole in active
  galactic nuclei (AGNs) are surrounded by a clumpy torus. We investigate the NIR
  flux variation of the torus in response to a UV flash for various geometries. Anisotropic
  illumination by the disk and the torus self-occultation contrast our study with
  earlier works. Both the waning effect of each clump and the torus self-occultation
  selectively reduce the emission from the region with a short delay. Therefore, the
  NIR delay depends on the viewing angle (where a more inclined angle leads to a longer
  delay), and the time response shows an asymmetric profile with negative skewness,
  opposing the results for optically thin tori. The range of the computed delay coincides
  with the observed one, suggesting that the viewing angle is primarily responsible
  for the scatter of the observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical
  color of type 1.8/1.9 objects is caused not only by the dust extinction but also
  the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness, both a thick
  and a thin tori display weaker NIR emission. A selection bias is thus expected such
  that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess moderately thick tori. A thicker torus shows
  a narrower and more heavily skewed time profile, while a thin torus produces a rapid
  response. A super-Eddington accretion rate leads to much weaker NIR emission due
  to the disk self-occultation and the disk truncation by self-gravity. A long delay
  is expected from an optically thin and/or a largely misaligned torus. Very weak
  NIR emission, such as in hot-dust-poor active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically
  thin torus, a super-Eddington accretion rate, or a slightly misaligned torus.
