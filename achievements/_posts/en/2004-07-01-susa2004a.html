abstract: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background by the Wilkinson
  Microwave Anisotropy Probe strongly suggest that the reionization of the universe
  took place quite early (z~17). On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the
  cold dark matter cosmology suffers from a substructure problem in which more subgalactic
  halos are produced in the Local Group than dwarf galaxies. In this Letter, as a
  potential mechanism for solving this problem, we consider the feedback effects of
  early reionization on the formation of small-scale structures. For this purpose,
  we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the
  radiative transfer for ionizing photons. As a result, it is found that the early
  reionization is devastating for low-mass systems with Mvir<~108 Msolar or vcirc<~20
  km s-1, and almost all gas is photoevaporated in more than 95% of low-mass systems.
  Such a strong negative feedback on the formation of low-mass galaxies may solve
  the substructure problem and support the picture that Local Group dwarf galaxies
  are descendants of the more massive halos that experienced and survived tidal stripping.
