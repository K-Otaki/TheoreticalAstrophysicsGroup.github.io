abstract: We investigate the optical emission-line flux ratios of narrow-line regions
  in order to determine whether the formation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets
  requires specific accretion conditions. We find that bright compact radio galaxies,
  which are powerful radio galaxies in the early stage of the jet activity, exhibit
  systematically larger flux ratios of [O I]lambda6300/[O III]lambda5007 and smaller
  flux ratios of [O III]lambda5007/[O III]lambda4363 than radio-quiet (RQ) Seyfert
  2 galaxies. Comparing the observed line ratios with photoionization models, it is
  found that the difference in the flux ratio of low- to high-ionization lines (e.g.,
  [O I]lambda6300/[O III]lambda5007) can be well understood by the difference in the
  spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. Powerful young radio-loud
  (YRL) AGNs favor SED without a strong big blue bump (BBB), i.e., a radiatively inefficient
  accretion flow (RIAF), while RQ AGNs are consistent with the models adopting SED
  with a strong BBB, i.e., a geometrically thin, optically thick disk. These findings
  imply that the formation of powerful AGN jets requires the accretion disk with harder
  ionizing SED (i.e., an RIAF). We discuss the obscuring structure of YRL AGNs as
  a plausible origin of the difference in flux ratios of [O III]lambda5007/[O III]lambda4363.
