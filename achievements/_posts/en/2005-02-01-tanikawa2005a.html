abstract: We investigated the evolution of star clusters in a steady external tidal
  field by means of N-body simulations. We followed seven sets of cluster models,
  whose central concentration and strength of the tidal field are different. We found
  that the mass-loss timescale due to the escape of stars, tmloss, and its dependence
  on the two-body relaxation timescale, trh, i, are determined by the strength of
  the tidal field. The logarithmic slope [â‰¡ d ln(t mloss)/d ln(trh, i)] approaches
  unity for the cluster models in weaker tidal fields. The timescale and the dependence
  are almost independent of the central concentration for clusters in tidal fields
  of the same strength. In our results, the scaling found by Baumgardt (2001, MNRAS,
  325, 1323) can be seen only in cluster models with moderately strong tidal fields.
