abstract: At the moment of deepest core collapse, a star cluster core contains less
  than ten stars. This small number makes the traditional treatment of hard binary
  formation, assuming a homogeneous background density, suspect. In a previous paper,
  we have found that indeed the conventional wisdom of binary formation, based on
  three-body encounters, is incorrect. Here we refine that insight, by further dissecting
  the subsequent steps leading to hard binary formation. For this purpose, we add
  some analysis tools in order to make the study less subjective. We find that the
  conventional treatment does remain valid for direct three-body scattering, but fails
  for resonant three-body scattering. Especially democratic resonance scattering,
  which forms an important part of the analytical theory of three-body binary formation,
  takes too much space and time to be approximated as being isolated, in the context
  of a cluster core around core collapse. We conclude that, while three-body encounters
  can be analytically approximated as isolated, subsequent strong perturbations typically
  occur whenever those encounters give rise to democratic resonances. We present analytical
  estimates postdicting our numerical results. If we only had been a bit more clever,
  we could have predicted this qualitative behaviour.
