abstract: We investigate the metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in the framework
  of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. The semi-analytical model we use, which
  has been used to study the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM) by
  Nagashima et al., includes the effects of flows of gas and metals both into and
  out of galaxies and the processes of metal enrichment due to both type Ia and type
  II supernovae. We adopt a solar neighbourhood initial mass function (IMF) for star
  formation in discs, but consider models in which starbursts have either a solar
  neighbourhood IMF or a top-heavy IMF. We find that the alpha-element abundance in
  ellipticals is consistent with observed values only if the top-heavy IMF is used.
  This result is consistent with our previous study on the metal enrichment of the
  ICM. We also discuss the abundance ratio of alpha elements to iron as a function
  of velocity dispersion and metallicity. We find that models with a top-heavy IMF
  match the alpha/Fe ratios observed in typical L* ellipticals, but none of the models
  reproduces the observed increase of alpha/Fe with velocity dispersion.
