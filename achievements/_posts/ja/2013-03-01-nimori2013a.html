abstract: We investigate the properties of massive, dense clouds formed in a barred
  galaxy and their possible relation to star formation, performing a two-dimensional
  hydrodynamical simulation with the gravitational potential obtained from the 2MASS
  data from the barred spiral galaxy, M83. Since the environment for cloud formation
  and evolution in the bar region is expected to be different from that in the spiral
  arm region, barred galaxies are a good target to study the environmental effects
  on cloud formation and the subsequent star formation. Our simulation uses for an
  initial 80 Myr isothermal flow of non-self gravitating gas in the barred potential,
  then including radiative cooling, heating and self-gravitation of the gas for the
  next 40 Myr, during which dense clumps are formed. We identify many cold, dense
  gas clumps for which the mass is more than 104 M&sun; (a value corresponding to
  the molecular clouds) and study the physical properties of these clumps. The relation
  of the velocity dispersion of the identified clump's internal motion with the clump
  size is similar to that observed in the molecular clouds of our Galaxy. We find
  that the virial parameters for clumps in the bar region are larger than that in
  the spiral arm region. From our numerical results, we estimate star formation in
  the bar and spiral arm regions by applying the simple model of Krumholz & McKee
  (2005). The mean relation between star formation rate and gas surface density agrees
  well with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The star formation efficiency
  in the bar region is Ëœ60 per cent of the spiral arm region. This trend is consistent
  with observations of barred galaxies.
