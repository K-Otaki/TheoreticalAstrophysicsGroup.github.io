abstract: We present the results of the extensive narrowband survey of Lyalpha emission-line
  objects at z = 3.1 in the 1.38 deg2 area surrounding the high-density region of
  star-forming galaxies at z = 3.09 in the SSA22 field, as well as in the 1.04 deg2
  area of the three separated general blank fields. In total, of 2161 Lyalpha emitters,
  there are 1394 in the SSA22 fields and 767 in the general fields detected at the
  narrowband AB magnitude limit of 25.73, which corresponds to the line flux of ≈1.8
  × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 or the luminosity of ≈1.5 × 1042 erg s-1 at z = 3.1, above
  the observed equivalent-width threshold, ≈190 Å. The average surface number density
  of the emitters at z = 3.1 in the general fields above the thresholds is 0.20 $\pm$
  0.01 arcmin-2. The SSA22 high-density region at z = 3.09, whose peak local density
  is six times that of the average, is found to be the most prominent outstanding
  structure in the whole surveyed area and is firmly identified as a robust "protocluster."
  We also compared the overdensity of the 100 arcmin2 and 700 arcmin2 areas which
  contain the protocluster with the expected fluctuation of the dark matter as well
  as those of the model galaxies in cosmological simulations. We found that the peak
  height values of the overdensity are 8-10 and 3-4 times the expected standard deviations
  for the counts of Lyalpha emitters at z = 3.1 in the corresponding volume, respectively.
  We conclude that the structure at z = 3.09 in the SSA22 field is a very significant
  and rare density peak up to the scale of ≈60 Mpc.
