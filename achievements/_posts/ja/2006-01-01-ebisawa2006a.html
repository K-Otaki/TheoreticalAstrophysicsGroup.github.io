abstract: Our current theoretical and observational understandings of the accretion
  disks around Galactic black-holes are reviewed. Historically, a simple phenomenological
  accretion disk model has been used to interpret X-ray observations. Although such
  a phenomenological interpretation is still useful, high quality X-ray data from
  contemporary instruments allow us to test more realistic accretion disk models.
  In a simple and ideal case, the standard optically thick accretion disk model is
  successful to explain observations, such that the inner disk radius is constant
  at three times the Schwarzschild radius over large luminosity variations. However,
  when disk luminosity is close to or exceeds the Eddington luminosity, the standard
  disk model breaks, and we have to consider the "slim disk" solution in which radial
  energy advection is dominant. Recent observations of Ultra-luminous X-ray sources
  (ULXs), which may not be explained by the standard disk model, strongly suggest
  the slim disk solution. We compare theoretical X-ray spectra from the slim disk
  with observed X-ray spectra of ULXs. We have found that the slim disk model is successful
  to explain ULX spectra, in terms of the massive stellar black-holes with several
  tens of solar mass and the super-Eddington mass accretion rates. In order to explain
  the large luminosities (>10 40 ergs s -1) of ULXs, "intermediate black-holes" (>100
  M&sun;) are not required. Slim disks around massive stellar black-holes of up to
  several tens of solar mass would naturally explain the observed properties of ULXs.
