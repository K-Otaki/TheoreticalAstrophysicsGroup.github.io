abstract: Ultra-high resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 10243 grid points are
  performed of a very large supernova burst in a forming galaxy, with properties similar
  to those inferred for Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Explosions produce kpc-sized
  expanding hot bubbles enclosed by cool, dense shells, and the engulfed gas is polluted
  with freshly-synthesised heavy elements. We show that the resultant inhomogeneous
  mixing produces a large spread ([Fe/H] ~ -1 to -5) of metallicities, which affects
  the subsequent galactic chemical evolution and leaves its imprint on metal-poor
  stars. By combining a spectral synthesis model with the numerical results, we predict
  Lyalpha emission from such galaxy at z=3. We find that the simulated galaxy, whose
  peak star formation rate is ~200M[[mdot]]yr-1, produces a Lyalpha luminosity Lalpha=
  9.7Ã—1042ergs-1. This value favorably matches the observed one, but some discrepancies
  are left for the Lyalpha line width, the metallicity, and X-ray properties. Since
  the results of the simulation is applicable only at the very early epoch of the
  galaxy formation, the metallicity is still lower than that of LBGs. However, the
  analysis presented here demonstrates a way to enable a systematic comparison with
  observational data. It is concluded that LBGs are optimal objects to scrutinise
  the early self-enrichment in forming galaxies. In the future, the predicted bubbly
  structure carved by SNe may be directly detected by high resolution observations
  with JWST.
