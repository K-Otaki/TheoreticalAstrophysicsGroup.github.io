abstract: We compare the results of various cosmological gas-dynamical codes used
  to simulate the formation of a galaxy in the Lambda cold dark matter structure formation
  paradigm. The various runs (13 in total) differ in their numerical hydrodynamical
  treatment [smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), moving mesh and adaptive mesh
  refinement] but share the same initial conditions and adopt in each case their latest
  published model of gas cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the common
  halo assembly history, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass,
  size, morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z= 0, due mainly to the different
  implementations of star formation and feedback. Compared with observation, most
  codes tend to produce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas rich than typical
  spirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disc is
  discernible in most simulations, although its prominence varies widely from code
  to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and the severity
  of the disagreement with observed spirals. In general, models that are more effective
  at limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observed galaxy
  scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disc component. Although numerical
  convergence is not particularly good for any of the codes, our conclusions hold
  at two different numerical resolutions. Some differences can also be traced to the
  different numerical techniques; for example, more gas seems able to cool and become
  available for star formation in grid-based codes than in SPH. However, this effect
  is small compared to the variations induced by different feedback prescriptions.
  We conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yet uniquely predict the properties
  of the baryonic component of a galaxy, even when the assembly history of its host
  halo is fully specified. Developing feedback algorithms that can effectively regulate
  the mass of a galaxy without hindering the formation of high angular momentum stellar
  discs remains a challenge.
