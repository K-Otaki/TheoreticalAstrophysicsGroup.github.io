abstract: We present a new interpretation of the Ton S180 spectrum obtained by the
  Chandra Spectrometer (Low Energy Transmission Grating). Several narrow absorption
  lines and a few emission disk lines have been successfully fitted to the data. We
  have not found any significant edges accompanying line emission. We propose an interpretation
  of narrow lines consistent with that of the recent paper by Krolik, in which a warm
  absorber is strongly inhomogeneous. Such a situation is possible in the so-called
  multiphase medium, where regions with different ionization states, densities, and
  temperatures may coexist in thermal equilibrium under constant pressure. We illustrate
  this scenario with theoretical spectra of radiation transferred through a stratified
  cloud with constant pressure (instead of constant density) computed by the TITAN
  code in plane-parallel approximation. Detected spectral features are faint, and
  their presence does not alter the broadband continuum. We model the broadband continuum
  of Ton S180 assuming an irradiated accretion disk with a dissipative warm skin.
  The set of parameters appropriate for the data cannot be determined uniquely, but
  models with low values of the black hole mass have too hot and radially extended
  a warm skin to explain the formation of soft X-ray disk lines seen in the data.
