abstract: We perform cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to determine to what extent
  galaxies lose their gas due to photoheating from an ionizing background. We find
  that the characteristic mass at which haloes on average have lost half of their
  baryons is Mc ~ 6.5 Ã— 109h-1Msolar at z = 0, which corresponds to a circular velocity
  of 25kms-1. This is significantly lower than the filtering mass obtained by the
  linear theory, which is often used in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.
  We demonstrate it is the gas temperature at the virial radius which determines whether
  a halo can accrete gas. A simple model that follows the merger history of the dark
  matter progenitors, and where gas accretion is not allowed when this temperature
  is higher than the virial temperature of the halo, reproduces the results from the
  simulation remarkably well. This model can be applied to any reionization history,
  and is easy to incorporate in semi-analytical models.
