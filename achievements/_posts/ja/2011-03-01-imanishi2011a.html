abstract: We present the results of infrared L-band (3-4mum) slit spectroscopy of
  30 PG QSOs at z < 0.17, a representative sample of local high-luminosity, optically
  selected AGNs. The 3.3mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature
  is used to probe nuclear (< a few kpc) starburst activity and to investigate the
  connections between AGNs and nuclear starbursts in PG QSOs. The 3.3mum PAH emission
  is detected in the individual spectra of 5/30 of the observed PG QSOs. We constructed
  a composite spectrum of PAH-undetected PG QSOs and discerned the presence of the
  3.3mum PAH emission therein. We estimated the nuclear-starburst and AGN luminosities
  from the observed 3.3mum PAH emission and 3.35mum continuum luminosities, respectively,
  and found that the nuclear-starburst-to-AGN luminosity ratios in PG QSOs are similar
  to those of previously studied AGN populations with lower luminosities, suggesting
  that AGN-nuclear starburst connections are valid over a wide luminosity range of
  AGNs in the local universe. The observed nuclear-starburst-to-AGN luminosity ratios
  in PG QSOs with available supermassive black-hole masses are comparable to a theoretical
  prediction based on the assumption that the growth of a supermassive black hole
  is controlled by starburst-induced turbulence.
