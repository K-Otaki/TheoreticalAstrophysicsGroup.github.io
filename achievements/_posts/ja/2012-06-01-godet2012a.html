abstract: The hyperluminous X-ray source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49, currently
  the best intermediate-mass black hole (BH) candidate, displays spectral transitions
  similar to those observed in Galactic BH binaries, but with a luminosity 100-1000
  times higher. We investigated the X-ray properties of this unique source by fitting
  multi-epoch data collected by Swift, XMM-Newton, and Chandra with a disk model computing
  spectra for a wide range of sub- and super-Eddington accretion rates assuming a
  non-spinning BH and a face-on disk (i = 0$\,^{i̧rc}$). Under these assumptions we
  find that the BH in HLX-1 is in the intermediate-mass range (~2 × 104 M &sun;) and
  the accretion flow is in the sub-Eddington regime. The disk radiation efficiency
  is eta = 0.11 $\pm$ 0.03. We also show that the source does follow the LX vprop
  T 4 relation for our mass estimate. At the outburst peaks, the source radiates near
  the Eddington limit. The accretion rate then stays constant around 4 × 10-4 M &sun;
  yr-1 for several days and then decreases exponentially. Such "plateaus" in the accretion
  rate could be evidence that enhanced mass-transfer rate is the driving outburst
  mechanism in HLX-1. We also report on the new outburst observed in 2011 August by
  the Swift X-Ray Telescope. The time of this new outburst further strengthens the
  ~1 year recurrence timescale.
