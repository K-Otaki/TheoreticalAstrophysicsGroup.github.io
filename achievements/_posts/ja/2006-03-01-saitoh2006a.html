abstract: Tidal disruption of dark matter halos around proto-globular clusters in
  the halo of a small galaxy is studied in the context of the hierarchical clustering
  scenario by using semicosmological N-body/SPH simulations assuming the standard
  cold dark matter model (Omega0=1). Our analysis on the formation and evolution of
  the galaxy and its substructures continues until z=2.0. In such a high-redshift
  universe, the Einstein-de Sitter universe is still a good approximation for the
  recently favored Lambda-dominated universe, and thus our results do not depend on
  the choice of cosmology. In order to resolve small gravitationally bound clumps
  around galaxies and consider radiative cooling below T=104 K, we adopt a fine mass
  resolution (mSPH=1.12Ã—103 Msolar). Because of the cooling, each clump immediately
  forms a ``core-halo'' structure that consists of a baryonic core and a dark matter
  halo. The tidal force from the host galaxy mainly strips the dark matter halo from
  clumps, and as a result, these clumps get dominated by baryons. Once a clump is
  captured by the host halo, its mass drastically decreases with each pericenter passage.
  At z=2, more than half of the clumps become baryon-dominated systems (baryon mass/total
  mass>0.5). Our results support the tidal evolution scenario of the formation of
  globular clusters and baryon-dominated dwarf galaxies in the context of the cold
  dark matter universe.
