abstract: We have performed hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in a cold
  dark matter (LambdaCDM) universe. We have followed galaxy formation in a dark matter
  halo, chosen to have a relatively quiet recent merger history, using different models
  for star formation and feedback. In all cases, we have adopted a multiphase description
  of the interstellar medium and modelled star formation in quiescent and burst modes.
  We have explored two triggers for starbursts - strong shocks and high gas density
  - allowing for the possibility that stars in the burst may form with a top-heavy
  initial mass function. We find that the final morphology of the galaxy is extremely
  sensitive to the modelling of star formation and feedback. Starting from identical
  initial conditions, galaxies spanning the entire range of Hubble types, with B-band
  disc-to-total luminosity ratios ranging from 0.2 to 0.9, can form in the same dark
  matter halo. Models in which starbursts are induced by high gas density (qualitatively
  similar to models in which feedback is produced by active galactic nuclei) generate
  energetic winds and result in galaxies with an early-type morphology. Models in
  which the starbursts are induced by strong shocks lead to extended discs. In this
  case, the feedback associated with the bursts suppresses the collapse of baryons
  in small haloes, helping to create a reservoir of hot gas that is available for
  cooling after z~= 1, following the bulk of the dynamical activity that builds up
  the halo. This gas then cools to form an extended, young stellar disc.
