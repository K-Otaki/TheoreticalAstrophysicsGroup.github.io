abstract: 'We investigate the evolution of angular momentum in simulations of galaxy
  formation in a cold dark matter universe. We analyse two model galaxies generated
  in the N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of Okamoto et al. Starting from identical
  initial conditions, but using different assumptions for the baryonic physics, one
  of the simulations produced a bulge-dominated galaxy and the other one a disc-dominated
  galaxy. The main difference is the treatment of star formation and feedback, both
  of which were designed to be more efficient in the disc-dominated object. We find
  that the specific angular momentum of the disc-dominated galaxy tracks the evolution
  of the angular momentum of the dark matter halo very closely: the angular momentum
  grows as predicted by linear theory until the epoch of maximum expansion and remains
  constant thereafter. By contrast, the evolution of the angular momentum of the bulge-dominated
  galaxy resembles that of the central, most bound halo material: it also grows at
  first according to linear theory, but 90 per cent of it is rapidly lost as pre-galactic
  fragments, into which gas had cooled efficiently, merge, transferring their orbital
  angular momentum to the outer halo by tidal effects. The disc-dominated galaxy avoids
  this fate because the strong feedback reheats the gas, which accumulates in an extended
  hot reservoir and only begins to cool once the merging activity has subsided. Our
  analysis lends strong support to the classical theory of disc formation whereby
  tidally torqued gas is accreted into the centre of the halo conserving its angular
  momentum.'
