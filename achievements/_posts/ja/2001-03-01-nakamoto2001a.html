abstract: Assuming simple dynamics for the growth of density fluctuations, we implement
  six-dimensional (6D) radiative transfer calculations to elucidate the effects of
  photon propagation during the reionization of an inhomogeneous universe. The ionizing
  sources are postulated to be AGN-like in this paper. The present simulations reveal
  that radiative transfer effects are still prominent considerably after the percolation
  epoch, in which patchy ionized regions connect with each other. In other words,
  owing to the collective opacity, the Universe does not become perfectly transparent
  against ionizing radiation even though strongly self-shielded regions disappear.
  It turns out that the inhomogeneity of the medium enhances the opacity effects and
  delays the end of reionization. Owing to such radiative transfer effects, the reionization
  in an inhomogeneous universe proceeds fairly slowly, in contrast to the prompt reionization
  in a homogeneous universe, and as a result the surface of reionization is not so
  sharply edged, but highly uneven. As a signature of the uneven surface of reionization,
  the cosmic IR background (CIB) radiation, which is produced by Lyalpha photons resulting
  from radiative recombination, could exhibit strong anisotropies, reflecting the
  amplitude of density fluctuations at the reionization era. The predicted CIB intensity
  lies on a level of possible detection by forthcoming IR space telescope facilities.
