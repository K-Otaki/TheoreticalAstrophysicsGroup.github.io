abstract: We investigate what we can learn about galaxy formation and evolution from
  the data which will be obtained by the forthcoming large submillimeter/millimeter
  facilities, mainly by the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) and
  the Atacama Large Millimeter Array/Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA/LMSA).
  We first calculate the source counts from 350 mum to 3 mm using the empirical infrared
  galaxy number count model of Takeuchi et al. Based on the number counts, we evaluate
  the source confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wave bands as
  a function of the characteristic beam size. At submillimeter wavelengths, source
  confusion with the 10-15 m class facilities becomes severe at the 0.1-1 mJy level,
  and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. However, we show that a
  very large area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mJy can provide
  a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z=1-2, and such a survey is
  suitable for the ASTE. In addition, such a survey enables us to study the clustering
  properties of submillimeter sources, which are still highly unknown. We also find
  that the 5 sigma confusion limit of LMSA is fainter than 1 muJy, which enables us
  to study the contribution of sources at extremely large redshift. When we discuss
  such a deep flux limit, the dynamic range of a detector should be taken into account,
  since extremely bright sources make it impossible to detect the faintest sources
  near the detection limit. We evaluate the probability that sources that are 103
  times brighter than the 5 sigma detection limit of LMSA and ALMA exist in the field
  of view. We find that the probability is <~3Ã—10-4, and therefore we do not have
  to worry about the dynamic range. The source counts at such faint flux levels give
  important information about the epoch of galaxy formation. We then show that multiband
  photometry from the infrared (by ASTRO-F) to the millimeter can be used as a redshift
  estimator. We examined the performance of this method by Monte Carlo simulations
  and found that it works successfully if we have reasonable measurement accuracy.
  In addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8 GHz source counts with our model
  counts to examine the contribution of star-forming galaxies to faint radio galaxies.
  We find that the faintest radio number counts (~1 muJy) are dominated by actively
  star-forming galaxies which lie at intermediate redshift z~1-2.
