abstract: We investigate environmental effects on evolution of bright cluster galaxies
  (L>L*) in a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter universe using a combination of dissipationless
  N-body simulations and a semianalytic galaxy formation model. The N-body simulations
  enable us to calculate orbits of galaxies in simulated clusters. Therefore, we can
  incorporate stripping of cold gas from galactic disks by ram pressure (RP) from
  the intracluster medium into our model. In this paper we study how ram pressure
  stripping (RPS) and small starburst induced by a minor merger affect colors, star
  formation rates (SFRs), and morphologies of cluster galaxies. These processes are
  new ingredients in our model and have not been studied sufficiently. We find that
  the RPS is not important for colors and SFRs of galaxies in the cluster core if
  the star formation timescale is properly chosen, because the star formation is sufficiently
  suppressed by consumption of the cold gas in the disks. Then observed color and
  SFR gradients can be reproduced without the RPS. The small starburst triggered by
  a minor merger hardly affects the SFRs and colors of the galaxies as well. We also
  examine whether these two processes can resolve the known problem that the hierarchical
  clustering models based on the major merger-driven bulge formation scenario predict
  too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T) in clusters.
  When the minor burst is taken into account, the intermediate B/T population is increased,
  and the observed morphology gradients in clusters are successfully reproduced. Without
  the minor burst, the RPS cannot increase the intermediate B/T population. On the
  other hand, when the minor burst is considered, the RPS also plays an important
  role in formation of the intermediate B/T galaxies. We present redshift evolution
  of morphological fractions predicted by our models. The predicted number ratios
  of the intermediate B/T galaxies to the bulge-dominated galaxies show nearly flat
  or slightly increasing trends with increasing redshift. We conclude that these trends
  are inevitable when bulges are formed through mergers. We discuss whether our results
  conflict with observationally suggested NS0/NE evolution in clusters, which is a
  decreasing function of redshift.
