abstract: Photometric observations of BL Lac were carried out during the large optical
  and X-ray outburst in 1997. Time-resolved photometry on 1997 August 2 revealed a
  rapid increase of brightness by about 0.6 mag within 40 min. This large-amplitude,
  short-time variation is the most active one among known variability of blazars in
  the optical wavelength. By considering a model based on the ``synchrotron self-Compton
  model'' of the relativistic jets of blazars, the size of the variable source should
  be R ~ 7.2 x 10^{{14}} cm from the 40 min variation. The power-density spectrum
  of the light curve on the night yielded a dependence of the power to the frequency
  f^{{-1.0}} for timescales of the variabilities and down to a possible minimum timescale
  of around 10 min. The clear difference between the observed f^{{-1.0}} dependence
  from the canonical f^{{-1.5}} --f^{{-1.8}} power indices observed in X-ray variations
  of radio-loud AGNs suggests that different mechanisms are responsible for short-term
  optical variability between BL Lacs and radio-loud AGNs.
