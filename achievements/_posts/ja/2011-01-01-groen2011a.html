abstract: We report on the performance of our cold dark matter cosmological N-body
  simulation that was carried out concurrently using supercomputers across the globe.
  We ran simulations on 60-750 cores distributed over a variety of supercomputers
  in Amsterdam (The Netherlands, Europe), in Tokyo (Japan, Asia), Edinburgh (UK, Europe)
  and Espoo (Finland, Europe). Regardless of the network latency of 0.32 s and the
  communication over 30 000 km of optical network cable, we are able to achieve ~87%
  of the performance compared to an equal number of cores on a single supercomputer.
  We argue that using widely distributed supercomputers in order to acquire more compute
  power is technically feasible and that the largest obstacle is introduced by local
  scheduling and reservation policies.
