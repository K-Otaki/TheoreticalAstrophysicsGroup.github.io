abstract: Ultra-high resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 10243 grid points are
  performed of early supernova burst in a forming galaxy, with properties similar
  to those inferred for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs).
  We show that, at the earliest stages of less than 300 Myr, continual supernova explosions
  produce multitudinous hot bubbles and cooled H(I) shells in-between. The H(I) shells
  radiate intense Lyman alpha (Ly alpha) emission like LAEs. We found that the bubbly
  structures produced are quite similar to the observed features in the Ly alpha surface
  brightness distribution of the extended LAEs. After 1 Gyr, the galaxies are dominated
  by stellar continuum radiation and then resemble the LBGs. At this point, the abundance
  of heavy elements appears to be solar. After 13 Gyr, these galaxies resemble present-day
  ellipticals.
