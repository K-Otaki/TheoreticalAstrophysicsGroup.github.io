abstract: 'Earth-mass dark matter microhalos with a size of ~100 AU are the first
  structures formed in the universe, if the dark matter of the universe is made of
  neutralinos. Here, we report the results of ultra-high-resolution simulations of
  the formation and evolution of these microhalos. We found that microhalos have the
  central density cusps of the form rho vprop r -1.5, much steeper than the cusps
  of larger dark halos. The central regions of these microhalos survive the encounters
  with stars except in the very inner region of the galaxy down to the radius of a
  few hundreds parsecs from the galactic center. The annihilation signals from the
  nearest microhalos are observed as gamma-ray point sources (radius less than 1''),
  with unusually large proper motions of ~0.2 deg yr-1. Their surface brightnesses
  are ~10% of that of the galactic center. Their signal-to-noise ratios might be better
  if they are far from the galactic plane. Luminosities of subhalos are determined
  only by their mass, and they are more than one order of magnitude more luminous
  than the estimation by Springel et al.: a boost factor can be larger than 1000.
  Perturbations to the millisecond pulsars by gravitational attractions of nearby
  Earth-mass microhalos can be detected by the observations of Parkes Pulsar Timing
  Array.'
