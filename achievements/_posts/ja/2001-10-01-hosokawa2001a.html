abstract: 'The cosmological evolution of the QSO luminosity functions (LFs) at NIR/optical/X-ray
  bands for 1.3 <~ z <~ 3.5 is discussed based on realistic QSO spectra. The accretion-disk
  theory predicts that although the QSO luminosities only depend on the mass-accretion
  rate, dot{M}, the QSO spectra have dependence on the black-hole mass, MBH, as well.
  The smaller is MBH and/or the larger is dot{M}, the harder does the QSO NIR/optical/UV
  spectrum become. We modeled the disk spectra which can reproduce these features,
  and calculated the LFs for a redshift of z ~ 3 with the assumption of new-born QSOs
  shining at the Eddington luminosity. The main results are: (i) the LFs observed
  at optical and X-ray bands can be simultaneously reproduced. (ii) LFs in the optical
  and X-ray bands are not sensitive to MBH, while LFs at the NIR bands are; about
  a one order of magnitude difference is expected in the volume number densities at
  LI,J ~ 1046 erg s-1 between the case that all QSOs would have the same spectral
  shape as that of MBH = 109Msolar and the case with MBH = 1011 Msolar. (iii) The
  resultant LFs at NIR are dominated by black holes at LI,J <~ 1044 erg s-1, and by
  1011Msolar black holes at LI,J >~ 1046 erg s-1. Future infrared observations from
  space (e.g. NGST) will probe the cosmological evolution of black-hole masses. For
  a redshift of z < 3, on the other hand, the observed optical/X-ray LFs can be fitted
  if the initial QSO luminosity, L0, is below the Eddington luminosity, LEdd. Interestingly,
  the best-fitted values of l ≡ L0/LEdd are different in the B- and X-ray bands; lB
  ≈ 2.5 lx. The reason for this discrepancy is briefly discussed.'
