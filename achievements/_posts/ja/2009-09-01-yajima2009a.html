abstract: In order to assess the contribution of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman
  alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshifts 3 < z < 7 to the ionization of intergalactic
  medium (IGM), we investigate the escape fractions of ionizing photons from supernova-dominated
  primordial galaxies by solving the three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer. The
  model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation of
  a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura, which well reproduces the observed properties
  of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of model galaxy is 1011Msolar. We solve not only
  photoionization but also collisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according
  to the chemical enrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking
  the size distributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction
  reduces the escape fractions by a factor of 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a factor
  of 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks increases
  the escape fractions by a factor of ~2. The resultant escape fractions are 0.07-0.47
  in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results are well concordant
  with the recent estimations derived from the flux density ratio at 1500 to 900 Ã…
  of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape fractions with the luminosity functions
  of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z LAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z = 3-5.
  However, ionizing radiation from LAEs as well as LBGs falls short of ionizing the
  IGM at z > 6. That implies that additional ionization sources may be required at
  z > 6.
