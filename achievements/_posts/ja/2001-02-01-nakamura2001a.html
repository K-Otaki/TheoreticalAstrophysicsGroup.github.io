abstract: The collapse and fragmentation of filamentary primordial gas clouds are
  explored using one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with
  the nonequilibrium processes of hydrogen molecule formation. The cloud evolution
  is computed from the initial central density nc=10-106 cm-3. The simulations show
  that depending on the initial density, there are two occasions for the fragmentation
  of primordial filaments. If a filament has relatively low initial density such as
  nc<~105 cm-3, the radial contraction is slow as a result of less effective H2 cooling
  and appreciably decelerates at densities higher than a critical density, where LTE
  populations are achieved for the rotational levels of H2 molecules and the cooling
  timescale becomes accordingly longer than the free-fall timescale. This filament
  tends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density reaches 108-109 cm-3,
  where H2 cooling by three-body reactions is effective and the fragment mass is more
  massive than some tens of Msolar. In contrast, if a filament is initially as dense
  as nc>~105 cm-3, the more effective H2 cooling with the help of three-body reactions
  allows the filament to contract up to n~1012 cm-3. After the density reaches n~1012
  cm-3, the filament becomes optically thick to H2 lines and the radial contraction
  subsequently almost stops. At this final hydrostatic stage, the fragment mass is
  lowered down to ~1 Msolar because of the high density of the filament. The dependence
  of the fragment mass upon the initial density could be translated into the dependence
  on the local amplitude of random Gaussian density fields or the epoch of the collapse
  of a parent cloud. Hence, it is predicted that the initial mass function of Population
  III stars is likely to be bimodal with peaks of ~102 and ~1 Msolar, where the relative
  heights could be a function of the collapse epoch. Implications for the metal enrichment
  by Population III stars at high redshifts and baryonic dark matter are briefly discussed.
