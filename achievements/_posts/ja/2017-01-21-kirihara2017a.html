abstract: We present diffuse Lyalpha haloes (LAHs) identified in the composite Subaru
  narrow-band images of 100-3600 Lyalpha emitters (LAEs) at z = 2.2, 3.1, 3.7, 5.7,
  and 6.6. First, we carefully examine potential artefacts mimicking LAHs that include
  a large-scale point-spread function made by instrumental and atmospheric effects.
  Based on our critical test with composite images of non-LAE samples whose narrow-band-magnitude
  and source-size distributions are the same as our LAE samples, we confirm that no
  artefacts can produce a diffuse extended feature similar to our LAHs. After this
  test, we measure the scalelengths of exponential profile for the LAHs estimated
  from our z = 2.2-6.6 LAE samples of LLyalpha ≳ 2 × 1042 erg s-1. We obtain the scalelengths
  of ~=5-10 kpc at z = 2.2-5.7, and find no evolution of scalelengths in this redshift
  range beyond our measurement uncertainties. Combining this result and the previously
  known UV-continuum size evolution, we infer that the ratio of LAH to UV-continuum
  sizes is nearly constant at z = 2.2-5.7. The scalelength of our z = 6.6 LAH is larger
  than 5-10 kpc just beyond the error bar, which is a hint that the scalelengths of
  LAHs would increase from z = 5.7 to 6.6. If this increase is confirmed by future
  large surveys with significant improvements of statistical and systematical errors,
  this scalelength change at z ≳ 6 would be a signature of increasing fraction of
  neutral hydrogen scattering Lyalpha photons, due to cosmic reionization.
