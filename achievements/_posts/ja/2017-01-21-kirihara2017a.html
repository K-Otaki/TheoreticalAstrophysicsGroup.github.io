abstract: Galaxies and massive black holes (BHs) presumably grow via galactic merging
  events and subsequent BH coalescence. As a case study, we investigate the merging
  event between the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and a satellite galaxy. We compute the
  expected observational appearance of the massive BH that was at the center of the
  satellite galaxy prior to the merger and is currently wandering in the M31 halo.
  We demonstrate that a radiatively inefficient accretion flow with a bolometric luminosity
  of a few tens of solar luminosities develops when Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto
  the BH is assumed. We compute the associated broadband spectrum and show that the
  radio band (observable with EVLA, ALMA, and the Square Kilometre Array) is the best
  frequency range in which to detect the emission. We also evaluate the mass and the
  luminosity of the stars bound by the wandering BH and find that such a star cluster
  is sufficiently luminous that it could correspond to one of the star clusters found
  by the PAndAS survey. The discovery of a relic massive BH wandering in a galactic
  halo will provide a direct means of investigating in detail the coevolution of galaxies
  and BHs. It also means a new population of BHs (off-center massive BHs) and offers
  targets for clean BH imaging that avoid strong interstellar scattering in the centers
  of galaxies.
