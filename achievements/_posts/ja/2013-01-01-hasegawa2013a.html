abstract: 'We explore the impacts of ultraviolet (UV) radiation feedback on galaxies
  during the epoch of reionization by cosmological simulations in which hydrodynamics
  and the transfer of the H and He ionizing photons are consistently coupled. Moreover,
  we take into account H2 non-equilibrium chemistry, including photodissociation.
  The most striking feature of the simulations is a high spatial resolution for the
  radiative transfer (RT) calculation which enables us to start considering not only
  external UV feedback processes but also internal UV feedback processes in each galaxy.
  We find that the star formation is significantly suppressed due to the internal
  UV and supernova (SN) feedback. In low-mass galaxies with M < 109 M&sun;, a large
  amount of gas is evacuated by photoevaporation as previous studies have shown, which
  results in the suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation in massive
  haloes is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these haloes hardly lose
  any gas by photoevaporation. The suppression of star formation in massive haloes
  is mainly caused by the following two factors: (i) small-scale clumpy structures
  in the galaxies are smoothened by the internal feedback; (ii) although the dense
  gas in the galaxies is mostly neutral, the H2 formation and cooling processes are
  disturbed by mild photoheating. Photodissociating radiations actually suppress star
  formation, but the magnitude of the effect is not so large in massive galaxies.
  Even though our simulation volume is too small to be a representative patch of the
  Universe during reionization, we find that our simulated star formation rate densities
  and H i fractions at z Ëœ 6-7 are consistent with those found in observations.'
