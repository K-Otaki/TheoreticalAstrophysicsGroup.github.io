abstract: X-ray observations of galaxy clusters have played an important role in cosmology,
  especially in determining the cosmological density parameter and the fluctuation
  amplitude.  While they represent the bright side of the universe together with the
  other probes including the cosmic microwave background and the Type Ia supernovae,
  the resulting information clearly indicates that the universe is dominated by dark
  components. Even most of cosmic baryons turns out to be dark. In order to elucidate
  the nature of dark baryons, we propose a dedicated soft-X-ray mission, DIOS (Diffuse
  Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor). Recent numerical simulations suggest that approximately
  30 to 50 percent of total baryons at z=0 take the form of the warm-hot intergalactic
  medium (WHIM) with 105 K< T < 107 K which has evaded the direct detection so far.  The
  unprecedented energy resolution (˜ 2eV) of the XSA (X-ray Spectrometer Array) on-board
  DIOS enables us to identify WHIM with gas temperature T=106˜ 107K and overdensity
  delta=10 ˜ 100 located at z<0.3 through emission lines of O VII and O VIII. In addition,
  WHIMs surrounding nearby clusters are detectable with a typical exposure time of
  a day, and thus constitute realistic and promising targets for DIOS.
