abstract: We argue that the origin of "FRI/FRII dichotomy"---the division between
  Fanaroff-Riley class I (FRI) with subsonic lobes and class II (FRII) radio sources
  with supersonic lobes is sharp in the radio-optical luminosity plane (Owen-White
  diagram)---can be explained by the deceleration of advancing radio lobes. The deceleration
  is caused by the growth of the effective cross-sectional area of radio lobes. We
  derive the condition in which an initially supersonic lobe turns into a subsonic
  lobe, combining the ram pressure equilibrium between the hot spots and the ambient
  medium with the relation between "the hot spot radius" and "the linear size of radio
  sources" obtained from the radio observations. We find that the dividing line between
  the supersonic lobes and subsonic ones is determined by the ratio of the jet power
  L j to the number density of the ambient matter at the core radius of the host galaxy
  \bar{n}_a. It is also found that the maximal ratio of (L_j/\bar{n}_a) exists and
  its value resides in (L_j/\bar{n}_a)_maxâ‰ˆ 10^{44-47} erg s^{-1} cm^{3}, taking into
  account considerable uncertainties. This suggests that the maximal value (L_j/\bar{n}_a)_max
  separates between FRIs and FRIIs.
