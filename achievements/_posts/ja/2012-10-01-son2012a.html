abstract: Young radio galaxies (YRGs) provide an ideal laboratory to explore the connection
  between the accretion disk and radio jet thanks to their recent jet formation. We
  investigate the relationship between the emission-line properties, the black hole
  accretion rate, and the radio properties using a sample of 34 low-redshift (z <
  0.4) YRGs. We classify YRGs as high-excitation galaxies (HEGs) and low-excitation
  galaxies (LEGs) based on the flux ratio of high-ionization to low-ionization emission
  lines. Using the Halpha luminosities as a proxy of accretion rate, we find that
  HEGs in YRGs have ~1 dex higher Eddington ratios than LEGs in YRGs, suggesting that
  HEGs have a higher mass accretion rate or higher radiative efficiency than LEGs.
  In agreement with previous studies, we find that the luminosities of emission lines,
  in particular Halpha, are correlated with radio core luminosity, suggesting that
  accretion and young radio activities are fundamentally connected.
