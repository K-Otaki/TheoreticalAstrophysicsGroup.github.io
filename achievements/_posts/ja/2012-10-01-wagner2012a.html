abstract: We examine the detailed physics of the feedback mechanism by relativistic
  active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets interacting with a two-phase fractal interstellar
  medium (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of galaxies using 29 three-dimensional grid-based
  hydrodynamical simulations. The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of
  cloud dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the maximum
  size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to their volume filling
  factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios P jet/L edd <~ 10-4,
  although systems with large cloud complexes >~ 50 pc require jets of Eddington ratio
  in excess of 10-2 to disperse the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the
  bubble expansion rates in our simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions
  resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a multi-phase
  treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume filling factor of warm-phase
  material is less than 0.1 and the cloud complexes are smaller than ~25 pc. We find
  that the acceleration of the dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure
  of the high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow that
  has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase gas it has swept up, and is additionally
  mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism transfers 10% to 40% of the
  jet energy to the cold and warm gas, accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr
  to velocities that match those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio
  galaxies hosting powerful radio jets.
