abstract: We explore the evolution of emissions by accelerated electrons in shocked
  shells driven by jets in active galactic nuclei. Focusing on powerful sources which
  host luminous quasars, we evaluated the broadband emission spectra by properly taking
  into account adiabatic and radiative cooling effects on the electron distribution.
  The synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton (IC) scattering of various photons
  that are mainly produced in the accretion disk and dusty torus are considered as
  radiation processes. We show that the resultant radiation is dominated by the IC
  emission for compact sources (lsim10 kpc), whereas the synchrotron radiation is
  more important for larger sources. We also compare shell emissions with those expected
  from the lobe under the assumption that the fractions of the energy deposited in
  the shell and lobe carried by non-thermal electrons are epsilon e  ~ 0.01 and epsilon
  e,lobe ~ 1, respectively. We find that shell emissions are brighter than lobe ones
  at infrared and optical bands when the source size is gsim10 kpc, and the IC emissions
  from the shell at gsim10 GeV can be observed with an absence of contamination from
  the lobe irrespective of the source size. In particular, it is predicted that, for
  most powerful nearby sources (L j ~ 1047 erg s-1), ~TeV gamma-rays produced via
  IC emissions can be detected by modern Cherenkov telescopes such as MAGIC, HESS,
  and VERITAS.
