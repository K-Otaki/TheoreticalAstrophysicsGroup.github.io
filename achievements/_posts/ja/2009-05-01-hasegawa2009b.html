abstract: We explore the impact of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from massive Population
  III (Pop III) stars of 25, 40, 80 and 120Msolar on the subsequent Pop III star formation.
  In this paper, particular attention is paid to the dependence of radiative feedback
  on the mass of source Pop III star. UV radiation from the source star can work to
  impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and photodissociation
  processes. Recently, Susa and Umemura have shown that the ionizing radiation alleviates
  the negative effect by H2-dissociating radiation from 120Msolar Pop III star, since
  an H2 shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can effectively shield H2-dissociating
  radiation. On the other hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by H2-dissociating
  radiation can be predominant if a source star is less massive, since a ratio of
  the H2-dissociating photon number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher.
  In order to investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars,
  we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the
  radiative transfer effect of ionizing and H2-dissociating radiation. As a result,
  we find that if a source star is less massive than ~25Msolar, the ionizing radiation
  cannot suppress the negative feedback of H2-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the
  fate of the neighbouring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely
  by the flux of H2-dissociating radiation from source stars. By making analytic estimates
  of H2 shell formation and its shielding effect, we derive the criteria for radiation
  hydrodynamic feedback depending on the source star mass.
