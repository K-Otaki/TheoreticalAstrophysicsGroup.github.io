abstract: We study the formation histories and present-day structure of satellite
  galaxies formed in a high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way like
  galaxy. The simulated satellites span nearly four orders of magnitude in luminosity
  but have a very similar mass within their inner 600 pc, ~3 × 107Msolar, with very
  little scatter. This result is in agreement with the recent measurements for dwarf
  spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Milky Way by Strigari et al. In our simulations,
  a preferred mass scale arises naturally from the effects of the early re-ionization
  of gas. These impose a sharp threshold of ~12kms-1 on the circular velocity of haloes
  which can cool gas and make stars. At the present day, subhaloes that host satellites
  as luminous as the classical Milky Way dwarfs (LV >= 2.6 × 105Lsolar) have typically
  grown to have circular velocities of >~20 km s-1. There are, however, subhaloes
  with similar circular velocities today which were, nevertheless, below threshold
  at re-ionization and thus remain dark. Star formation in above-threshold haloes
  is truncated when the halo is accreted into the main galaxy progenitor. Thus, many
  properties of today's dwarf satellites such as their luminosity and star formation
  rate are set by their accretion time.
