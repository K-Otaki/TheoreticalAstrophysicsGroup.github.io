abstract: We explore the emissions by accelerated electrons in shocked shells driven
  by jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Focusing on powerful sources which host
  luminous quasars, the synchrotron radiation and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering
  of various photons that are mainly produced in the core are considered as radiation
  processes. We show that the radiative output is dominated by the IC emission for
  compact sources (â‰² 30 kpc), whereas the synchrotron radiation is more important
  for larger sources. It is predicted that, for powerful sources (Lj ~ 1047 ergs s-1),
  GeV - TeV gamma-rays produced via the IC emissions can be detected by the Fermi
  satellite and modern Cherenkov telescopes such as MAGIC, HESS and VERITAS if the
  source is compact.
