abstract: We report on the detection of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signals toward
  the most luminous X-ray cluster RX J1347-1145 at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory
  (21 and 43 GHz) and with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (350 GHz). In particular,
  the latter is the first successful detection of the SZ temperature increment in
  the submillimeter band that resolved the profile of a cluster of galaxies. Both
  the observed spectral dependence and the radial profile of the SZ signals are fully
  consistent with those expected from the X-ray observation of the cluster. The combined
  analysis of the 21 and 350 GHz data reproduces the temperature and core radius of
  the cluster that are determined with ROSAT and ASCA when we adopt the slope of the
  density profile from the X-ray observations. Therefore, our present data provide
  the strongest and most convincing case for the detection of the submillimeter SZ
  signal from the cluster as well as in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. We also discuss
  briefly the cosmological implications of the present results.
