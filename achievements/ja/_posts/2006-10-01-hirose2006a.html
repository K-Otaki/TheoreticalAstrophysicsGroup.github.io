abstract: We propose a novel method of extracting the imprint of gravitational lensing
  by Population III stars in the light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Significant
  portions of GRBs can originate in hypernovae of Population III stars and be gravitationally
  lensed by foreground Population III stars or their remnants. If the lens mass is
  on the order of 102-103 Msolar and the lens redshift is greater than 10, the time
  delay between two lensed images of a GRB is ~1 s and the image separation is ~10
  muas. Although it is difficult to resolve the two lensed images spatially with current
  facilities, the light curves of the two images are superimposed with a delay of
  ~1 s. GRB light curves usually exhibit noticeable variability, where each spike
  is less than 1 s. If a GRB is lensed, all spikes are superimposed with the same
  time delay. Hence, if the autocorrelation of the light curve with changing time
  interval is calculated, it should show resonance at the time delay of the lensed
  images. Applying this autocorrelation method to GRB light curves that are archived
  as the BATSE catalog, we demonstrate that more than half of the light curves show
  recognizable resonance they are lensed. Furthermore, in 1821 GRBs we actually find
  one candidate for a GRB lensed by a Population III star, which may be located at
  redshift 20-200. The present method is quite straightforward and therefore provides
  an effective tool for searching for Population III stars at redshift greater than
  10. Using this method, we may find more candidates for GRBs lensed by Population
  III stars in the data of the Swift satellite.
