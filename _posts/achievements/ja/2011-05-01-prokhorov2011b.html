abstract: 'Aims: Measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel''dovich (hereafter SZ) effect distortion
  of the cosmic microwave background provide methods to derive the gas pressure and
  temperature of galaxy clusters. Here we study the ability of SZ effect observations
  to derive the electron distribution function (DF) in massive galaxy clusters.  Methods:
  Our calculations of the SZ effect include relativistic corrections considered within
  the framework of the Wright formalism and use a decomposition technique of electron
  DFs into Fourier series. Using multi-frequency measurements of the SZ effect, we
  find the solution of a linear system of equations that is used to derive the Fourier
  coefficients; we further analyze different frequency samples to decrease uncertainties
  in Fourier coefficient estimations.  Results: We propose a method to derive DFs
  of electrons using SZ multi-frequency observations of massive galaxy clusters. We
  found that the best frequency sample to derive an electron DF includes high frequencies
  nu = 375, 600, 700, 857 GHz. We show that it is possible to distinguish a Juttner
  DF from a Maxwell-Bolzman DF as well as from a Juttner DF with the second electron
  population by means of SZ observations for the best frequency sample if the precision
  of SZ intensity measurements is less than 0.1%. We demonstrate by means of 3D hydrodynamic
  numerical simulations of a hot merging galaxy cluster that the morphologies of SZ
  intensity maps are different for frequencies nu = 375, 600, 700, 857 GHz. We stress
  that measurements of SZ intensities at these frequencies are a promising tool for
  studying electron distribution functions in galaxy clusters.'
