abstract: The coevolution of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a bulge is considered
  based on a novel mechanism for BH formation, where the BH growth is promoted by
  the mass accretion driven by radiation drag which is exerted on dusty interstellar
  gas in radiation fields generated by bulge stars. It turns out that the resultant
  mass of a SMBH is predicted to be in proportion to the bulge mass, and the mass
  ratio is basically determined by the nuclear energy conversion efficiency from hydrogen
  to helium, Îµ = 0.007. In the present scenario, the bulge luminosity overwhelms the
  BH accretion luminosity in the growing phase of SMBH. This phase corresponds to
  a ``proto-QSO'', thereafter evolving to a QSO. Also, the proto-QSO phase is preceded
  by an optically-thick ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) phase.
