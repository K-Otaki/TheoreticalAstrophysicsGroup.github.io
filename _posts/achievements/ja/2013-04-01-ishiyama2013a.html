abstract: We present the results of the "Cosmogrid" cosmological N-body simulation
  suites based on the concordance LCDM model. The Cosmogrid simulation was performed
  in a 30 Mpc box with 20483 particles. The mass of each particle is 1.28 Ã— 105 M
  &sun;, which is sufficient to resolve ultra-faint dwarfs. We found that the halo
  mass function shows good agreement with the Sheth & Tormen fitting function down
  to ~107 M &sun;. We have analyzed the spherically averaged density profiles of the
  three most massive halos which are of galaxy group size and contain at least 170
  million particles. The slopes of these density profiles become shallower than -1
  at the innermost radius. We also find a clear correlation of halo concentration
  with mass. The mass dependence of the concentration parameter cannot be expressed
  by a single power law, however a simple model based on the Press-Schechter theory
  proposed by Navarro et al. gives reasonable agreement with this dependence. The
  spin parameter does not show a correlation with the halo mass. The probability distribution
  functions for both concentration and spin are well fitted by the log-normal distribution
  for halos with the masses larger than ~108 M &sun;. The subhalo abundance depends
  on the halo mass. Galaxy-sized halos have 50% more subhalos than ~1011 M &sun; halos
  have.
