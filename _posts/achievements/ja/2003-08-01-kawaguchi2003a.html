abstract: 'Super-Eddington accretion onto black holes (BHs) may occur at ultraluminous
  compact X-ray sources in nearby galaxies, Galactic microquasars, and narrow-line
  Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). Effects of electron scattering (opacity and Comptonization)
  and the relativistic correction (gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler effect)
  on the emergent spectra from super-Eddington accretion flows onto nonrotating BHs
  are examined for 101.5 and 106.5 Msolar BH masses (MBH). With m[â‰¡M/(LEdd/c2)]>=100
  (where M is the accretion rate), the spectral hardening factor via electron scattering
  is <~2.3-6.5. As a result of the m-sensitive hardening factor, the color temperature
  of the innermost radiation is not proportional to L0.25, differing from the simplest
  standard accretion disk. The model is applied to optical-soft X-ray emission from
  NLS1s. We pick up one NLS1, namely, PG 1448+273 with an inferred MBH of 106.4 Msolar,
  among the highest m candidates. The broadband spectral distribution is successfully
  reproduced by the model with an extremely high m (=1000) and the viscosity parameter
  alpha of 0.01. This implies that this object, as well as some other highest m systems,
  is really young: the inferred age, MBH/M, is about 106 yr. We also briefly discuss
  the distribution of m for transient and highly variable NLS1s, finding that those
  are located at 3<~m<~300. Such a moderately high accretion rate is indicative of
  thermal instability. Furthermore, m for a possible type 2 counterpart of NLS1s,
  NGC 1068, is found to be similar to m for NLS1s.'
