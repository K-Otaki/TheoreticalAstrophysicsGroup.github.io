abstract: We present a new prediction of GeV gamma-ray emission from radio lobes of
  young active galactic nuclei jets. In the previous work of Kino, Kawakatu & Ito,
  MeV gamma-ray bremsstrahlung emission was predicted from young cocoons/radio lobes
  in the regime of no coolings. In this study, we include cooling effects of bremsstrahlung
  emission and adiabatic loss. With the initial conditions determined by observed
  young radio lobes, we solve a set of equations describing the expanding lobe evolution.
  Then, we find that the lobes initially have electron temperature of ~GeV, and they
  cool down to ~MeV by the adiabatic loss. Correspondingly, the lobes initially yield
  bright bremsstrahlung luminosity in ~GeV range and they fade out. We estimate these
  gamma-ray emissions and show that nearby young radio lobes could be detected with
  Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
