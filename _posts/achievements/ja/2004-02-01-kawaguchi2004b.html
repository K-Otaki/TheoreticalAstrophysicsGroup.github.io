abstract: 'Self-gravitating accretion discs have only been studied in a few nearby
  objects using maser spots at the parsec-scale. We find a new spectral window for
  observing the self-gravitating accretion disc in super-Eddington accreting Active
  Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This window is determined by calculating the outermost radius
  (rsg) of a non self-gravitating disc and the corresponding emission wavelength (lambdasg)
  as a function of various disc parameters. We find that lambdasg reaches ˜4000  Å
  for alpha=0.1, when M&sun; ≳ 70   (MBH / 107  M&sun;)-1 LEdd/c2 (where &alpha,;
  M&sun;, MBH and LEdd are, respectively, the viscosity parameter, gas accretion rate
  onto the central black hole (BH), the BH mass and the Eddington luminosity). Moreover,
  lambdasg is as small as ˜ 1500  Å for alpha =0.001, which is the smallest alpha
  case in this study. Therefore, the window for observing the self-gravitating part
  of an AGN accretion disc is from ˜ 2 mum to lambdasg. Incidentally, rsg can be less
  than the photon trapping radius for M&sun; ≳ 103.3 LEdd/c2. Namely, a self-gravitating,
  optically-thick, advection-dominated accretion disc is expected to appear in the
  extremely high accretion rate regime.  Next, we demonstrate that the Mid-Infrared
  to X-ray spectrum of a bright, well-studied Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy, Ton S
  180, is indeed well fitted by the spectrum arising from the following three components:
  an inner slim disc (with a corona), an outer, self-gravitating non-Keplerian disc
  and a dusty torus. The total mass, BH mass plus the entire disc mass, is found to
  be about (1.4 - 8.0)  MBH. If the surface density varies with radius r in proportion
  to r-0.6, the total mass is consistent with the central mass estimated by Hβand
  [O III] widths.'
