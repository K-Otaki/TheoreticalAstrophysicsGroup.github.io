abstract: We investigate the properties of satellite galaxies formed in N-body/SPH
  simulations of galaxy formation in the LambdaCDM cosmology. The simulations include
  the main physical effects thought to be important in galaxy formation and, in several
  cases, produce realistic spiral discs. In total, a sample of nine galaxies of luminosity
  comparable to the Milky Way was obtained. At magnitudes brighter than the resolution
  limit, MV = -12, the luminosity function of the satellite galaxies in the simulations
  is in excellent agreement with data for the Local Group. The radial number density
  profile of the model satellites, as well as their gas fractions also match observations
  very well. In agreement with previous N-body studies, we find that the satellites
  tend to be distributed in highly flattened configurations whose major axis is aligned
  with the major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. In two out of three systems
  with sufficiently large satellite populations, the satellite system is nearly perpendicular
  to the plane of the galactic disc, a configuration analogous to that observed in
  the Milk Way. The discs themselves are perpendicular to the minor axis of their
  host haloes in the inner parts, and the correlation between the orientation of the
  galaxy and the shape of the halo persists even out to the virial radius. However,
  in one case the disc's minor axis ends up, at the virial radius, perpendicular to
  the minor axis of the halo. The angular momenta of the galaxies and their host halo
  tend to be well aligned.
