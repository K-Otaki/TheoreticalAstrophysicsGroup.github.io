abstract: We quantitatively scrutinize the effects of the radiation drag arising from
  the radiation fields in a galactic bulge in order to examine the possibility that
  the radiation drag could be an effective mechanism to extract angular momentum in
  a spheroidal system like a bulge and allow plenty of gas to accrete on to the galactic
  centre. For this purpose, we numerically solve the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical
  equation coupled with accurate radiative transfer, and quantitatively assess the
  radiation drag efficiency. As a result, we find that in an optically thick regime
  the radiation drag efficiency is sensitively dependent on the density distributions
  of the interstellar medium (ISM). The efficiency drops according to tauT-2 in an
  optically thick uniform ISM, where tauT is the total optical depth of the dusty
  ISM, whereas the efficiency remains almost constant at a high level if the ISM is
  clumpy. Hence, if bulge formation begins with a star formation event in a clumpy
  ISM, the radiation drag will effectively work to remove the angular momentum and
  the accreted gas may form a supermassive black hole. As a natural consequence, this
  mechanism reproduces a putative linear relation between the mass of a supermassive
  black hole and the mass of a galactic bulge, although further detailed modelling
  for stellar evolution is required for a more precise prediction.
