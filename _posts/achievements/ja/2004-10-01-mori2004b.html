abstract: We consider a forming galaxy undergoing multitudinous supernova (SN) explosions
  as a possible model of Lyalpha blobs (LABs). For this purpose, an ultra-high-resolution
  hydrodynamic simulation is performed using 10243 grid points, where SN remnants
  are resolved with sufficient accuracy. It is found that multiple SN explosions produce
  kiloparsec-size expanding hot bubbles, which drive cool, dense shells by strong
  shock. The colliding high-density cooling shells radiate intensive Lyalpha emission,
  resulting in a high Lyalpha luminosity of ~1043 ergs s-1, comparable to the observed
  level in LABs. Also, recently discovered bubbly features in some LABs are quite
  similar to the structure predicted in the present simulation. Furthermore, the result
  demonstrates that LABs are representative of evolving primordial galaxies; they
  could hold direct information on the early chemical enrichment of galaxies, contrary
  to present-day galaxies that have undergone intense recycling of interstellar matter,
  thus erasing most of the early chemical history. It turns out that the metal mixing
  proceeds in a very inhomogeneous fashion, so that there appears a large spread of
  metallicity, that is, [Fe/H]~0 to-5 or [O/H]~1 to-4. Hence, the early galactic chemical
  evolution may have proceeded in a different manner from that hitherto considered
  in one-zone models.
