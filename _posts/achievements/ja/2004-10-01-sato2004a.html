abstract: We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of gas stripping by radiation
  drag from interstellar clouds moving in uniform radiation fields. To include relativistic
  radiation drag properly, the radiation hydrodynamic equation is solved taking into
  account the dilution of radiation fields by the optical depth of the cloud. As a
  result, it is found that the optically thin surface layers are effectively stripped
  by radiation drag from an optically thick gas cloud, and, simultaneously, the stripped
  gas loses momentum. The momentum loss time-scale is found to be on the order of
  108 yr under the intensive radiation fields expected in the early phase of galaxy
  evolution. The present results show that the radiation drag is an effective mechanism
  for extracting angular momentum from the interstellar medium and allows it to accrete
  on to the galactic centre. Mass accretion driven by radiation drag may lead to the
  formation of a central supermassive black hole.
