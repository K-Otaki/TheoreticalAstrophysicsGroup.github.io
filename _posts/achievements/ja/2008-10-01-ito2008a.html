abstract: 'We investigate the total kinetic power (Lj) and age (tage) of powerful
  jets in FR II radio galaxies by comparison of the dynamical model of expanding cocoons
  with observations. We select four FR II radio sources (Cygnus A, 3C 223, 3C 284,
  and 3C 219), for which the mass-density profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM)
  are known in the literature. It is found that large fractions >~0.02-0.7 of the
  Eddington luminosity (LEdd) are carried away as kinetic power of jets. The upper
  limit of estimated 2Lj/LEdd is larger than unity (<~10) for some sources, suggesting
  the possibility of super-Eddington mass accretions. As a consequence of the large
  powers, we also find that the total energy stored in the cocoon (Ec) exceeds the
  energy derived from the minimum energy condition for the energy of radiating nonthermal
  electrons and magnetic fields (Emin): 4<Ec/Emin<310. This implies that most of the
  energy in the cocoon is carried by invisible components such as thermal leptons
  (electron and positron) and/or protons.'
