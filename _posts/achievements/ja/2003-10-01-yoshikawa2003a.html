abstract: Most of the cosmic baryons predicted by the big-bang nucleosynthesis have
  evaded direct detection. Recent numerical simulations indicate that approximately
  30 to 50 percent of the total baryons in the present universe are supposed to take
  the form of warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) whose X-ray continuum emission
  is very weak. To identify those missing baryons, we consider in detail the detectability
  of WHIM directly through the emission lines of O VII (561, 568, 574, 665eV) and
  O VIII (653eV). For this purpose, we create mock spectra of the emission lines of
  WHIM using a light-cone output of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. While the
  predicted fluxes are generally below the current detection limit, an unambiguous
  detection will be feasible with a dedicated X-ray satellite mission, which we also
  discuss in detail. Our proposed mission is especially sensitive to a WHIM with gas
  temperature of T = 106-7 K and overdensity of delta = 10 - 100 up to a redshift
  of 0.3 without being significantly contaminated by the cosmic X-ray background and
  the Galactic emissions. Thus, such a mission provides a unique and important tool
  to identify a large fraction of otherwise elusive baryons in the universe.
