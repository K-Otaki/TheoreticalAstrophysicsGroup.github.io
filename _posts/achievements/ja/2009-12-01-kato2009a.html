abstract: By solving the radiative transfer equations, we examine the three-dimensional
  radiative properties of a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow model conforming to
  the observed spectrum of Sgr A* in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole at
  the Galactic Centre. As a result, we find that the core of the radio emission is
  larger than the size of the event horizon shadow and its peak location is shifted
  from the gravitational centre. We also find that the self-absorbed synchrotron emission
  arising from the superposition of thermal electrons within a few tens of the Schwartzschild
  radius can account for low-frequency spectra below the critical frequency nuc ~
  1012Hz. Above the critical frequency, the synchrotron self-Compton emission from
  thermal electrons can account for the variable emission found in recent near-infrared
  observations. In contrast to a previous study by Ohsuga, Kato & Mineshige, we found
  that the X-ray spectra arising from bremsstrahlung emission of thermal electrons
  for the different mass accretion rates can be consistent with both the flaring state
  and the quiescent state of Sgr A* observed by Chandra.
