abstract: We examine plasma composition of jets in active galactic nuclei through
  the comparison of the total pressure (P) with partial pressures of electrons and
  protons in a cocoon. The total pressure is estimated from the analysis of expanding
  cocoon dynamics. We determine the average kinetic energy per particle for several
  representative cases of particle energy distribution such as one- and two-temperature
  thermal plasmas and non-thermal electrons by evaluating the dissipation of the total
  kinetic energy of the jet into the internal energy of cocoon plasma. The number
  density of the total electrons/positrons (n $\pm$) in the cocoon is constrained
  by using the particle supply from hot spots and the absence of thermal bremsstrahlung
  emission from radio lobes. By inserting P, n $\pm$, and the particle energy of each
  population into the equation of state, the number density (np ) and pressure (Pp
  ) of protons in the cocoon can be constrained. Applying this method to Cygnus A,
  we find that (1) electron/positron (e $\pm$) pairs always dominate in terms of number
  density, but that (2) either an "e $\pm$-supported cocoon (i.e., P $\pm$ > Pp )"
  or a "proton-supported one (i.e., P $\pm$ < Pp )" is possible.
