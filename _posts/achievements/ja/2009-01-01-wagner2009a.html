abstract: We present a time-dependent cosmic-ray (CR) modified shock model for which
  the calculated Halpha emissivity profile agrees well with the Halpha flux increase
  ahead of the Balmer-dominated shock at knot g in Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR),
  observed by Lee et al. The backreaction of the CR component on the thermal component
  is treated in the two-fluid approximation, and we include thermal particle injection
  and energy transfer due to the acoustic instability in the precursor. The transient
  state of our model that describes the current state of the shock at knot g occurs
  during the evolution from a thermal gas dominated shock to a smooth CR-dominated
  shock. Assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc to Tycho's remnant, we obtain values for the
  CR diffusion coefficient, kappa, the injection parameter, epsilon, and the timescale
  for the energy transfer, tau, of kappa = 2 × 1024 cm2 s-1, epsilon = 4.2 × 10-3,
  and tau = 426 yr, respectively. We have also studied the parameter space for fast
  (300 km s-1 lsim vs lsim 3000 km s-1), time-asymptotically steady shocks and have
  identified a branch of solutions, for which the temperature in the CR precursor
  typically reaches 2 × 104 to 6 × 104 K and the bulk acceleration of the flow through
  the precursor is less than 10 km s-1. These solutions fall into the low CR acceleration
  efficiency regime and are relatively insensitive to shock parameters. This low CR
  acceleration efficiency branch of solutions may provide a natural explanation for
  the line broadening of the Halpha narrow component observed in nonradiative shocks
  in many SNRs.
