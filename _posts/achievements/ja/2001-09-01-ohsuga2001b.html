abstract: We explore the formation of dusty gas walls induced by a circumnuclear starburst
  around an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We concentrate our attention on the role
  of the radiation force of a starburst as well as an AGN, in which the effects of
  the optical depth of dusty gas are taken into consideration. First, we solve the
  hydrostatic equations in spherical symmetry coupled with the frequency-dependent
  radiative processes to demonstrate that a geometrically thin, optically thick wall
  forms because of the radiation pressure of a circumnuclear starburst. Next, in two-dimensional
  axisymmetric space, we analyze the configuration and the stability of geometrically
  thin walls that are balanced between radiation pressure and gravity. As a result,
  it is shown that the radiation force of the circumnuclear starburst works to stabilize
  optically thick walls surrounding the nucleus. In the case of a brighter starburst
  with a fainter AGN (e.g., LSB/MSB>~10 [Lsolar/Msolar] and LAGN<~1011 Lsolar), there
  form double walls, the inner one of which is located between the nucleus and the
  circumnuclear starburst and the outer one of which enshrouds both the starburst
  regions and the nucleus. The total extinction of both walls turns out to be larger
  for a brighter starburst, which is AV~10 mag for LSB/MSB>~102 (Lsolar/Msolar). As
  a consequence, double walls could heavily obscure the nucleus to make this a type
  2 AGN. The outer wall may provide an explanation for the recent indications for
  large-scale obscuring materials in Seyfert 2 galaxies. Also, it is predicted that
  the AGN type is time-dependent according to the stellar evolution in the starburst,
  which shifts from type 2 to type 1 in several times 107 yr owing to the disappearance
  of walls. In contrast, if the AGN itself is much brighter than the starburst, as
  a quasar is, then neither wall forms regardless of the starburst activity, and the
  nucleus is likely to be identified as type 1. To conclude, the radiatively supported
  gas walls could be responsible for the putative correlation between AGN type and
  the starbursts, whereby Seyfert 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with circumnuclear
  starbursts than type 1 galaxies, whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 AGNs
  regardless of the star-forming activity in the host galaxies.
