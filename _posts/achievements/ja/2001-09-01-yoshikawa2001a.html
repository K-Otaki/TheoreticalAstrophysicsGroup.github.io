abstract: We perform an extensive analysis of nonlinear and stochastic biasing of
  galaxies and dark halos in a spatially flat, low-density cold dark matter universe
  (Omega0=0.3, lambda0=0.7, h=0.7, and sigma8=1) using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.
  We identify galaxies by linking cold and dense gas particles that satisfy the Jeans
  criterion. We compare their biasing properties with the predictions of an analytic
  halo biasing model. Dark halos in our simulations exhibit reasonable agreement with
  the predictions only on scales larger than ~10 h-1 Mpc; on smaller scales, the volume
  exclusion effect of halos due to their finite size becomes substantial. Interestingly,
  the biasing properties of galaxies are better described by extrapolating the halo
  biasing model predictions. The clustering amplitudes of galaxies are almost independent
  of the redshift between z=0 and 3, as reported in previous simulations. This in
  turn leads to a rapidly evolving biasing factor; we find that bcov~=1 at redshift
  z~=0 and bcov~=3-4 at z=3, where bcov is a biasing parameter defined from the linear
  regression of galaxy and dark matter density fields. Those values are consistent
  with the observed clustering of Lyman break galaxies. We also find the clear dependence
  of galaxy biasing on formation epoch; the distribution of old populations of galaxies
  tightly correlates with the underlying mass density field while that of young populations
  is slightly more stochastic and antibiased relative to dark matter. The amplitude
  of the two-point correlation function of old populations is about 3 times larger
  than that of young populations. Furthermore, the old population of galaxies resides
  within massive dark halos while the young galaxies are preferentially formed in
  smaller dark halos. Assuming that the observed early- and late-type galaxies correspond
  to the simulated old and young populations of galaxies, respectively, all of these
  segregations of galaxies are consistent with observational ones for early- and late-type
  galaxies such as, e.g., the morphology-density relation of galaxies.
