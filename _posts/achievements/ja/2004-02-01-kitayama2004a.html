abstract: Foreseeing the era of high spatial resolution measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
  effect (SZE) in clusters of galaxies, we present a prototype analysis of this sort
  combined with Chandra X-ray data. It is applied specifically to RX J1347-1145 at
  z = 0.451, the most X-ray-luminous galaxy cluster known, for which the highest resolution
  SZE and X-ray images are currently available. We demonstrate that the combined analysis
  yields a unique probe of complex structures in the intracluster medium, offering
  determinations of their temperature, density, and line-of-sight extent. For a subclump
  in RX J1347-1145, previously discovered in our SZE map, the temperature inferred
  after removing the foreground and background components is well in excess of 20keV,
  indicating that the cluster has recently undergone a violent merger. Excluding the
  region around this subclump, the SZE signals in submillimeter to centimeter bands
  (350, 150, and 21GHz) are all consistent with those expected from Chandra X-ray
  observations. We further present a temperature deprojection technique based on the
  SZE and X-ray images, without any knowledge of spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy.
  The methodology presented here will be applicable to a statistical sample of clusters
  available in the future SZE surveys.
