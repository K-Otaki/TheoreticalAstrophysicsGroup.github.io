abstract: We present the first systematic search for extended metal-line [O II] lambdalambda3726,
  3729 nebulae, or [O II] blobs (O IIBs), at z = 1.2 using deep narrowband imaging
  with a survey volume of 1.9 × 105 Mpc3 on the 0.62 deg2 sky of Subaru-XMM Deep Survey
  (SXDS) field. We discover a giant O IIB, called "O IIB 1," with a spatial extent
  over ~75 kpc at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 1.18, and also identify a total
  of 12 O IIBs with a size of >30 kpc. Our optical spectrum of O IIB 1 presents [Ne
  V] lambda3426 line at the 6sigma level, indicating that this object harbors an obscured
  type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN). The presence of gas outflows in this object
  is suggested by two marginal detections of Fe II lambda2587 absorption and Fe II*
  lambda2613 emission lines both of which are blueshifted at as large as 500-600 km
  s-1, indicating that the heating source of O IIB 1 is AGN or associated shock excitation
  rather than supernovae produced by starbursts. The number density of O IIB 1-type
  giant blobs is estimated to be ~5 × 10-6 Mpc-3 at z ~ 1.2, which is comparable with
  that of AGNs driving outflow at a similar redshift, suggesting that giant O IIBs
  are produced only by AGN activity. On the other hand, the number density of small
  O IIBs, 6 × 10-5 Mpc-3, compared to that of z ~ 1 galaxies in the blue cloud in
  the same MB range, may imply that 3% of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 are quenching
  star formation through outflows involving extended [O II] emission.
