abstract: In the last decade, numerous Lyman alpha (Lyalpha) emitters (LAEs) have
  been discovered with narrow-band filters at various redshifts. Recently, multiwavelength
  observations of LAEs have been performed and revealed that while many LAEs appear
  to be young and less massive, a noticeable fraction of LAEs possess much older populations
  of stars and larger stellar mass. How these two classes of LAEs are concordant with
  the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been understood clearly so far.
  In this paper, we model LAEs by three-dimensional cosmological simulations of dark
  halo merger in a Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) universe. As a result, it is
  shown that the age of simulated LAEs can spread over a wide range from 2 × 106 to
  9 × 108yr. Furthermore, we find that there are two types of LAEs, in one of which
  the young half-mass age is comparable to the mean age of stellar component, and
  in the other of which the young half-mass age is appreciably shorter than the mean
  age. We define the former as Type 1 LAEs and the latter as Type 2 LAEs. A Type 1
  LAE corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy, whereas a Type 2 LAE does
  to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy, as a consequence of delayed accretion
  of a subhalo on to a larger parent halo. Thus, the same halo can experience a Type
  2 LAE phase as well as a Type 1 LAE phase in the merger history. Type 1 LAEs are
  expected to be younger than 1.5 × 108yr, less dusty and less massive with stellar
  mass Mstar <~ 5 × 108Msolar, while Type 2 LAEs are older than 1.5 × 108yr, even
  dustier and as massive as Mstar ~ 5 × 108-3 × 1010Msolar. The fraction of Type 2s
  in all LAEs is a function of redshift, which is less than 2 per cent at z >~ 4.5,
  ~30 per cent at redshift z = 3.1 and ~70 per cent at z = 2. Type 2 LAEs can be discriminated
  clearly from Type 1s in two-colour diagrams of z' - H versus J - K. We find that
  the brightness distribution of Lyalpha in Type 2 LAEs is more extended than the
  main stellar component, in contrast to Type 1 LAEs. This is not only because delayed
  starbursts tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy, but also because Lyalpha
  photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy. Hence, the extent
  of Lyalpha emission may be an additional measure to distinguish Type 2 LAEs from
  Type 1 LAEs. The sizes of Type 2 LAEs range from a few tens to a few hundreds kpc.
  At lower redshifts, the number of more extended, older Type 2 LAEs increases. Furthermore,
  it is anticipated that the amplitude of angular correlation function for Type 2
  LAEs is significantly higher than that for Type 1 LAEs, but comparable to that for
  Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). This implies that LBGs with strong Lyalpha line may
  include Type 2 LAEs.
