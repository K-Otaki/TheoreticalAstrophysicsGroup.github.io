abstract: Over cosmic time, galaxies grow through the hierarchical merging of smaller
  galaxies. However, the bright region of the galaxy luminosity function is incompatible
  with the simplest version of hierarchical merging, and it is believed that feedback
  from the central black hole in the host galaxies reduces the number of bright galaxies
  and regulates the co-evolution of the black hole and host galaxy. Numerous simulations
  of galaxy evolution have attempted to include the physical effects of such feedback
  with a resolution usually exceeding a kiloparsec. However, interactions between
  jets and the interstellar medium involve processes occurring on less than kiloparsec
  scales. In order to further the understanding of processes occurring on such scales,
  we present a suite of simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal
  two-phase interstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale
  of one kiloparsec. The transfer of energy and momentum to the interstellar medium
  is considerable, and we find that jets with powers in the range of 1043-1046 erg
  s-1 can inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the galaxy
  core. We determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of the ratio
  of the jet power to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, the pressure of
  the interstellar medium, and the porosity of the dense gas.
