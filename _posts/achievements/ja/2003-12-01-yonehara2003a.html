abstract: Recently, a ``CDM crisis'' is being discussed. The main point of this crisis
  is that the number of substructures presented by cosmological N-body simulations
  based on the CDM scenario for structure formation is much larger than the observed
  substructures. Therefore, it is crucial for this crisis to discriminate whether
  the expected number of CDM substructures really exist without detectable radiation,
  or do not exist. In this paper, we present a new idea to detect such invisible substructures
  by utilizing gravitational lensing. Here, we consider quasars that are gravitationally
  lensed by a foreground galaxy. A substructure around a lensing galaxy may superposed
  on one of the lensed images of such quasars. In this situation, additional image
  splitting should occur in the image behind the substructure, and additional multiple
  images are created. From our estimations, the separation and time delay between
  the additional multiple images are expected to be 1-30 milli-arcsecond and 1-103
  second, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate that the optical depth for such events
  is sim 0.1. Consequently, future fine-resolution imaging and/or high-speed monitoring
  will unable us to find invisible substructures in one of a few multiple quasars.
