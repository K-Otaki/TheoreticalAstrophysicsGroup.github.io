abstract: We compare the highly clustered populations of very high redshift galaxies
  with protoclusters identified numerically in a standard LambdaCDM universe (Omega0=0.3,
  lambda0=0.7) simulation. We evolve 2563 dark matter particles in a comoving box
  of side 150 h-1 Mpc. By the present day there are 63 cluster-sized objects of mass
  in excess of 1014 h-1 Msolar in this box. We trace these clusters back to higher
  redshift, finding that their progenitors at z=4-5 are extended regions of typically
  20-40 Mpc (comoving) in size, with dark halos of mass in excess of 1012 h-1 Msolar
  and are overdense by typically 1.3-13 times the cosmological mean density. Comparison
  with observations of Lyalpha-emitting galaxies at z=4.86 and 4.1 indicates that
  the observed excess clustering is consistent with that expected for a protocluster
  region if Lyalpha emitters typically correspond to massive dark halos of more than
  1012 h-1 Msolar. We give a brief discussion of the relation between the high-redshift
  concentration of massive dark halos and present-day rich clusters of galaxies.
