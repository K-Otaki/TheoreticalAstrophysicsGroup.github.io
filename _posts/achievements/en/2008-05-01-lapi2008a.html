abstract: Motivated by the recent observational and theoretical evidence that long
  gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are likely associated with low metallicity, rapidly rotating
  massive stars, we examine the cosmological star formation rate (SFR) below a critical
  metallicity Zcrit ~ 1/10-1/5Zsolar, to estimate the event rate of high redshift
  long GRB progenitors. To this purpose, we exploit a galaxy formation scenario already
  successfully tested on a wealth of observational data on (proto)spheroids, Lyman
  break galaxies, Lyman alpha emitters, submm galaxies, quasars and local early-type
  galaxies. We find that the predicted rate of long GRBs amounts to about 300 events
  yr-1 sr-1, of which about 30 per cent occur at z >~ 6. Correspondingly, the GRB
  number counts well agree with the bright SWIFT data, without the need for an intrinsic
  luminosity evolution. Moreover, the above framework enables us to predict the properties
  of the GRB host galaxies. Most GRBs are associated with low-mass galaxy haloes MH
  <~ 1011Msolar, and effectively trace the formation of small galaxies in such haloes.
  The hosts are young, with age smaller than 5 × 107 yr, gas rich, but poorly extincted
  (AV <~ 0.1) because of their chemical immaturity; this also implies high specific
  SFR and quite extreme alpha-enhancement. Only the minority of hosts residing in
  large haloes with MH >~ 1012Msolar has larger extinction (AV ~ 0.7 - 1), SFRs exceeding
  100Msolaryr-1 and can be detected at submm wavelengths. Most of the hosts have ultraviolet
  magnitudes in the range -20 <~ M1350 <~ -16, and Lyman alpha luminosity in the range
  2 × 1040 <~ LLymanalpha <~ 2 × 1042 erg s-1. GRB hosts are thus tracing the faint
  end of the luminosity function of Lyman break galaxies and Lyman alpha emitters.
  Finally, our results imply that the population of `dark' GRBs occur mostly in faint
  hosts at high redshift, rather than in dusty hosts at low redshift.
