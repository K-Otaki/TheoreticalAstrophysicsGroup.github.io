abstract: The pancake collapse of pregalactic clouds under UV background radiation
  is explored with a one-dimensional sheet model. Here, attention is concentrated
  on elucidating the basic physics on the thermal evolution of pregalactic clouds
  exposed to diffuse UV radiation. So, we treat accurately the radiation transfer
  for the ionizing photons, with solving chemical reactions regarding hydrogen molecules
  as well as atoms. The self-shielding against UV radiation by H2 Lyman-Werner bands,
  which regulates the photodissociation of hydrogen molecules, is also taken into
  account. As a result, it is found that when the UV background radiation is at a
  level of 10-22(nu/nuL)-1 ergs s-1 cm-2 Hz-1 sr-1, the cloud evolution bifurcates
  with a critical mass as MSB=2.2×1011 Msolar[(1+zc)/5]-4.2, where zc is the final
  collapse epoch. A cloud more massive than MSB cools below 5×103 K owing to H2 line
  emission at the pancake collapse and would undergo the initial starburst. The pancake
  possibly evolves into a virialized system in a dissipationless fashion. Consequently,
  this leads to the dissipationless galaxy formation at 3<~zc<~10. A cloud less massive
  than MSB cannot cool by H2 emission shortly after the pancake collapse but could
  cool in the course of shrinking to the rotation barrier. This is likely to lead
  to the dissipational galaxy formation at relatively low redshifts as 0<~zc<~4. The
  present results provide a solid physical mechanism that controls the star formation
  efficiency in the pregalactic clouds. In the context of a standard CDM cosmology,
  MSB lies between 1 sigma and 2 sigma density fluctuations.
