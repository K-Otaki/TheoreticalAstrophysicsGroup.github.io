abstract: The matter content of jets in active galactic nuclei is examined in a new
  way. We model the dynamical expansion of its cocoon embedded in the intra-cluster
  medium (ICM). By comparing the observed shape of the cocoon with that expected from
  the theoretical model, we estimate the total pressure (Pc) and electron temperature
  (Te) of the cocoon. The number density of the total electrons (ne-) is constrained
  by using the non-thermal spectrum of the hot spot and the analysis of the momentum
  balance between the jet thrust and the rum pressure of ICM. Together with the obtained
  Pc, Te and ne-, we constrain the matter content in the jets. We find that, in the
  case of Cygnus A, the ratio of number density of protons to that of electrons is
  of order of 10-3 . This implies the existence of a large number of positron in the
  jet.
