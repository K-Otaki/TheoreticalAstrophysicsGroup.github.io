abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium ionization state and a two-temperature
  structure of the intracluster medium in the linked region of Abell 399 and Abell
  401, using a series of N-body + Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations,
  and find that there exist significant shock layers at the edge of the linked region
  and that the ionization state of iron departs from the ionization equilibrium state
  at the shock layers and around the center of the linked region. As for the two-temperature
  structure, an obvious difference in temperature between electrons and ions is found
  in the edge of the linked region. The Kalpha line emissions of FeXXIV and FeXXV
  are not severely affected by the deviation from the ionization equilibrium state
  around the center of the linked region, suggesting that the detection of relatively
  high metallicity in this area cannot be ascribed to a non-equilibrium ionization
  state of the intracluster medium. On the other hand, the Kalpha emissions significantly
  deviate from the equilibrium values at the shock layers, and the intensity ratio
  of the Kalpha lines between FeXXIV-XXV and FeXXVI is found to be significantly different
  from that in the ionization equilibrium state.
