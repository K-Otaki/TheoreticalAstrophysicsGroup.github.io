abstract: We examine the possibility of active galactic nucleus (AGN) obscuration
  by dusty gas clouds that spurt out from circumnuclear starburst regions. For this
  purpose, the dynamical evolution of gas clouds is pursued, including the effects
  of radiation forces by an AGN as well as a starburst. Here we solve the radiative
  transfer equations for clouds, taking into consideration the growth of clouds by
  inelastic cloud-cloud collisions and the resultant change in optical depth. As a
  result, if the starburst is more luminous than the AGN, gas clouds are distributed
  extensively above the galactic disk with the assistance of radiation pressure from
  the starburst. The total covering factor of gas clouds reaches a maximum of about
  20%. After several 107 yr, gas clouds with larger optical depth form by cloud-cloud
  collisions; thereafter the clouds fall back as a result of weakened radiation pressure.
  The larger clouds undergo runaway growth and are eventually distributed around the
  equatorial plane on the inner sides of circumnuclear starburst regions. These clouds
  have an optical depth of several tens. The result is qualitatively consistent with
  the putative tendency that Seyfert 2 galaxies appear more frequently associated
  with starbursts than Seyfert 1 galaxies. On the other hand, if the AGN luminosity
  overwhelms that of the starburst, almost all clouds are ejected from the galaxy
  as a result of the radiation pressure from the AGN, resulting in the formation of
  a quasar-like object. The origin of obscuration of AGNs is discussed with relevant
  observations.
