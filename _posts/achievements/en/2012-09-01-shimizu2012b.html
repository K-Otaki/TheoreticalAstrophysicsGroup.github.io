abstract: 'By use large cosmological Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics simulations,
  we explore observed properties of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs). We develop a phenomenological
  model of absorption, scattering and escape of Lyman alpha (Lyalpha) photons motivated
  by Neufeld (1991). In our model, we assume that the clumpiness of the inter-stellar
  medium in a galaxy is correlated with the larger scale substructure richness. As
  a result, we reproduce, for the first time, all of the following observed properties
  of LAEs at z=3.1: Lyalpha luminosity function, UV luminosity function of LAEs, the
  angular correlation function and the equivalent width distribution of Lya line.
  In this poster, we will discuss not only the statistical properties of LAEs at the
  other redshift (z = 2 ~ 6), but also the relation between LAEs and the other high-z
  galaxies such as Lyman break galaxies and Submm galaxies.'
