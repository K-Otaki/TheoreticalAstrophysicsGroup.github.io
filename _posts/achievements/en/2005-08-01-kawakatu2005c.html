abstract: The hydrodynamic formation of massive black holes (BHs) in globular clusters
  is considered. In particular, we examine the possibility of BH formation induced
  by the radiation drag that is exerted on the interstellar matter by stellar radiation
  in globular clusters. The radiation drag extracts angular momentum from interstellar
  gas and thus allows the gas to accrete onto the cluster center. By incorporating
  the realistic chemical evolution of globular clusters, we scrutinize the efficiency
  of the radiation drag to assess the total accreted mass. As a result, we find that
  if a globular cluster is more massive than ~6Ã—106 Msolar in the present-day stellar
  component, a massive BH with >260 Msolar can form within it. But the BH-to-cluster
  mass ratio is considerably smaller than the BH-to-bulge mass ratio (~10-3) found
  in galactic bulges. The results are not sensitive to the assumed stellar initial
  mass function and star formation rate in the cluster, as long as the resulting color-magnitude
  relation, metallicity, and mass-to-luminosity ratio satisfy those observed in globular
  clusters. Hence, the putative linear relation between BH mass and bulge mass (MBH-Mbulge
  relation) cannot be extrapolated to globular cluster systems. In the present regime,
  we discuss the BH formation in M15, G1, omega Cen, the M33 nucleus, and the compact
  X-ray sources in M82. Finally, we discuss observational indications of the formation
  process of massive BHs in globular clusters. We find that the final phase of BH
  growth due to the radiation drag can be observed as ultraluminous X-ray sources
  (ULXs) with ~1041 ergs s-1.
