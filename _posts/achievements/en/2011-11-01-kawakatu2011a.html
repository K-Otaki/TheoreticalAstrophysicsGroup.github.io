abstract: We propose a new method to explore the candidate super-Eddington active
  galactic nuclei (AGNs). We examine the properties of infrared (IR) emission from
  the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are powered by super- or sub-Eddington
  accretion flows around black holes, by considering the dependence of the polar angle
  on the radiation flux of accretion flows. We find that for super-Eddington AGNs,
  of which the mass accretion rate is more than 102 times larger than the Eddington
  rate, the ratio of the AGN IR luminosity and the disc bolometric luminosity is less
  than 10-2, unless the half opening angle of the torus (thetatorus) is small (thetatorus
  < 65$\,^{i̧rc}$). This is due to the self-occultation effect, whereby the self-absorption
  at the outer region of the super-Eddington flow dilutes the illumination of the
  torus. Such a small luminosity ratio is not observed in sub-Eddington AGNs, whose
  mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than 10 times larger than the Eddington
  mass accretion rate, except for extremely thin tori (thetatorus > 85$\,^{i̧rc}$).
  We also consider the properties of the near-IR (NIR) emission radiated from hot
  dust >1000 K. We find that super-Eddington AGNs have a ratio of the NIR luminosity
  to the bolometric luminosity, LNIR, AGN/Lbol, disc, at least one order of magnitude
  smaller than for sub-Eddington AGNs for a wide range of half opening angle (thetatorus
  > 65$\,^{i̧rc}$), for various types of dusty torus model. Thus, a relatively low
  LNIR, AGN/Lbol, disc is a property that allows identification of candidate super-Eddington
  AGNs. Lastly, we discuss the possibility that NIR-faint quasars at redshift z˜ 6
  discovered by a recent deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey may be young quasars whose
  black holes grow via super-Eddington accretion.
