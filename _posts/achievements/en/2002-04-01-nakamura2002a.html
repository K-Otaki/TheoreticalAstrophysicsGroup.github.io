abstract: In the context of star formation through fragmentation of an extremely metal
  deficient protogalactic cloud, the gravitational collapse of filamentary gas clouds
  is explored with one-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics coupled with nonequilibrium
  chemistry of H2 and HD. It is found that the cloud evolution is governed mainly
  by the initial central density (nc,0) and H2 abundance (xH2,0). In particular, the
  evolution of low-density filaments (nc,0<~105 cm-3) bifurcates at a threshold H2
  abundance of xH2,cr~=3×10-3, beyond which HD cooling overwhelms H2 cooling. The
  contraction of a filament with nc,0<~105 cm-3 and xH2,0>~xH2,cr is strongly decelerated
  when the central density (nc) reaches a critical density of HD at which LTE level
  populations are achieved, and therefore the filament is expected to fragment at
  ~107 cm-3. The fragment mass is lowered to be ~10 Msolar. In contrast, the contraction
  of a filament with nc,0<~105 cm-3 and xH2,0<~xH2,cr is regulated by H2 cooling.
  In this case, the filament tends to fragment at lower density as ~104 cm-3 owing
  to the low critical density of H2, and the fragment mass is as high as ~102 Msolar.
  For a high-density filament with nc,0>~105 cm-3, the temperature stays at a relatively
  high value because both H2 and HD cooling saturate, and the cloud evolution is governed
  by H2 cooling. The contraction of a high-density filament is accelerated by effective
  three-body H2 formation when the density reaches 108-109 cm-3. Fragmentation is
  not expected to take place until the cloud becomes opaque in H2 lines at nc,0~1012-1013
  cm-3, so that the fragment mass is reduced to 1-2 Msolar. As a result, the stellar
  initial mass function could be bimodal and deficient in sub-solar mass stars, where
  the high-mass peak is around 10 or 102 Msolar, dependent on nc,0 and xH2,0. If the
  protogalactic clouds are ionized by UV radiation or strong shocks, the H2 abundance
  could exceed xH2,cr~=3×10-3 by reactions of H+e-->H-+hnu and H+H--->H2+e. The high-mass
  peak would then be O(10)Msolar.
