abstract: We present a model to investigate the formation and evolution of cluster
  galaxies using cosmological high-resolution N-body simulations. The N-body simulations
  are used to construct merging history trees of dark halos. Gas cooling, star formation,
  supernova feedback, and mergers of galaxies within dark halos are included by using
  simple prescriptions taken from semianalytic models of galaxy formation. In this
  paper, we examine the merger-driven bulge formation model and represent the morphology-density
  relation of cluster galaxies at z=0. We find that this morphological evolution model
  can explain the distribution of elliptical galaxies in the clusters well and cannot
  reproduce the distribution of S0 galaxies. This result suggests that the elliptical
  galaxies are mainly formed by the major mergers, while, in the S0 formation, processes
  other than major mergers play an important role.
