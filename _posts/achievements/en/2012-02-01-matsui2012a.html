abstract: Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with multiple (>=3) nuclei are
  frequently observed. It has been suggested that these nuclei are produced by multiple
  major mergers of galaxies. The expected rate of such mergers is, however, too low
  to reproduce the observed number of ULIRGs with multiple nuclei. We have performed
  high-resolution simulations of the merging of two gas-rich disk galaxies. We found
  that extremely massive and compact star clusters form from the strongly disturbed
  gas disks after the first or second encounter between the galaxies. The mass of
  such clusters reaches ~108 M &sun; and their half-mass radii are 20-30 pc. Since
  these clusters consist of young stars, they appear as several bright cores in the
  galactic central region (~kpc). The peak luminosity of these clusters reaches ~10%
  of the total luminosity of the merging galaxy. These massive and compact clusters
  are consistent with the characteristics of the observed multiple nuclei in ULIRGs.
  Multiple mergers are not necessary to explain multiple nuclei in ULIRGs.
