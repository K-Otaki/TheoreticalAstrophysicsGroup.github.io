abstract: 'We study statistical methods for the estimation of the luminosity function
  (LF) of galaxies. We focus on four nonparametric estimators: the 1/Vmax estimator,
  the stepwise maximum-likelihood estimator, Choloniewski''s estimator, and the improved
  Lynden-Bell estimator. The performance of the 1/Vmax estimator has recently been
  questioned, especially for the faint-end estimation of the LF. We improve these
  estimators for studies of the distant universe, and examine their performances for
  various classes of functional forms by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply these
  estimation methods to the mock Two-Degree Field (2dF) redshift survey catalog prepared
  by Cole et al. We find that the 1/Vmax estimator yields a completely unbiased result
  if there is no inhomogeneity, but is not robust against clusters or voids. This
  is consistent with the well-known results, and we do not confirm the bias trend
  of 1/Vmax claimed by Willmer in the case of a homogeneous sample. We also find that
  the other three maximum-likelihood type estimators are quite robust and give consistent
  results with each other. In practice, we recommend Choloniewski''s estimator for
  two reasons: (1) it simultaneously provides the shape and normalization of the LF;
  and (2) it is the fastest among these four estimators, because of its algorithmic
  simplicity. We then analyze the photometric redshift data of the Hubble Deep Field
  prepared by Fern√°ndez-Soto et al. using the above four methods. We also derive the
  luminosity density, rhoL, at the B and I bands. Our B-band estimation is roughly
  consistent with that of Sawicki, Lin, & Yee, but it is a few times lower at 2.0<z<3.0.
  The evolution of rhoL(I) is found to be less prominent.'
