abstract: 'We investigate effects of time evolution of a rich cluster of galaxies
  on its member galactic halos in the standard cold dark matter (SCDM) universe using
  high resolution N-body simulations. We identify several hundred galactic halos within
  the virial radius of our simulated cluster. We also find that a large number of
  halos have been tidally disrupted at z=0. Therefore we improve a method of deriving
  merging history trees of galaxies taking account of tidally stripped galaxies. The
  main results are as follows: (1) At high redshift (z~=2), the mass function of the
  galactic halos that are in the cluster at z=0 is very similar to that obtained in
  the field region and agrees well with the Press-Schechter mass function. (2) The
  mass function of cluster galaxies that consist of both galactic halos and tidally
  stripped galaxies has hardly evolved since z~=2. This mass function at z=0 is well
  represented by the Press-Schechter mass function at z=2. (3) At high redshift (z>3),
  in the region that becomes the cluster, the fraction of galaxies that have undergone
  recent merger is larger than that in the field. After z~3, however, it rapidly decreases
  and becomes smaller than that in the field. (4) The fraction of strongly stripped
  galaxies among the cluster galaxies begins to increase from z~=0.5. At z=0, a clear
  correlation appears between this fraction and the distance from the center of the
  cluster. (5) Tidally truncated halos have steeper outer profiles than those of the
  model of Navarro, Frenk, & White.'
