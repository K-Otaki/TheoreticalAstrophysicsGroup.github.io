abstract: We investigated the correlation between nuclear/circumnuclear starbursts
  around active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the AGN activities for 43 Seyfert galaxies
  in the CfA and 12 mum samples. We found that the circumnuclear starburst luminosity,
  as well as the nuclear starburst luminosity, is positively correlated with the AGN
  luminosity. Moreover, the nuclear starburst luminosity is more strongly correlated
  with the AGN luminosity normalized with the AGN Eddington luminosity than is the
  circumnuclear starburst luminosity. This implies that starbursts nearer the AGN
  could have a greater effect on AGN mass accretion. We also discuss these results
  from the viewpoint of the radiation effects from starbursts and sequential starbursts.
