abstract: We explore the possibility for the formation of Population III binaries.
  The collapse of a rotating cylinder is simulated with a three-dimensional, high-resolution
  nested grid, assuming the thermal history of primordial gas. The simulations are
  done with dimensionless units, and the results are applicable to low-mass as well
  as massive systems by scaling with the initial density. We find that if the initial
  angular momentum is as small as beta~0.1, where beta is the ratio of centrifugal
  force to pressure force and is of the order of 10%, then the runaway collapse of
  the cloud stops to form a rotationally supported disk. After the accretion of the
  envelope, the disk undergoes a ring instability, eventually fragmenting into a binary.
  If the initial angular momentum is relatively large, a bar-type instability arises,
  resulting in the collapse into a single star through rapid angular momentum transfer.
  The present results show that a significant fraction of Population III stars are
  expected to form in binary systems, even if they are quite massive or less massive.
  The cosmological implications of Population III binaries are briefly discussed.
