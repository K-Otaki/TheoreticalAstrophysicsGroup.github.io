abstract: We investigate environmental effects on evolution of bright cluster galaxies
  in a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter universe using a combination of dissipationless
  N-body simulations and a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. We incorporate effects
  of ram-pressure stripping (RPS) and minor merger-induced small starburst (minor
  burst) into our model. By considering minor burst, the observed morphology-radius
  relation is successfully reproduced. When we do not consider minor burst, the RPS
  hardly increases the intermediate B/T population. In addition, the RPS and minor
  burst are not important for colours or star formation rates of galaxies in the cluster
  core if star formation time-scale is properly chosen, because the star formation
  is sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas. We also find that SF
  in bulge-dominated galaxies is mainly terminated by starburst induced by major mergers
  in all environments.
