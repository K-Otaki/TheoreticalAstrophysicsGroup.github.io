abstract: 'We investigate the magnitude and internal alignment of the angular momentum
  of cold dark matter haloes in simulations with and without baryons. We analyse the
  cumulative angular momentum profiles of hundreds of thousands of well-resolved haloes
  in the Millennium Simulation of Springel et al. and in a smaller, but higher resolution,
  simulation, in total spanning 5 orders of magnitude in mass. For haloes of a given
  mass, the median specific angular momentum increases with radius as j(<=r) ~ r.
  The direction of the vector varies considerably with radius: the median angle between
  the inner (<~0.25Rvir) and total (<=Rvir) angular momentum vectors is about 25$\,^{i̧rc}$.
  To investigate how baryons affect halo spin, we use another high-resolution simulation,
  which includes gas cooling, star formation and feedback. This simulation produces
  a sample of galaxies with a realistic distribution of disc-to-total ratios, D/T:
  two-thirds of the galaxies have D/T > 0.5 in the B band. The formation of the galaxy
  spins up the dark matter within 0.1Rvir such that the specific halo angular momentum
  increases by ~50 per cent in the median. The dark matter angular momentum becomes
  better aligned, but there remains a broad distribution of (mis-)alignments between
  the halo and the central galaxy, with a median angle between their angular momenta
  of ~30$\,^{i̧rc}$. Galaxies have a range of orientations relative to the shape of
  the halo: half of them have their minor axes misaligned by more than 45$\,^{i̧rc}$,
  although only about 10 per cent of the galaxies lie within 30$\,^{i̧rc}$ of the
  plane perpendicular to the major axis of their halo. Finally, we align a sample
  of haloes according to the orientation of their galaxies and stack the projected
  mass distributions. Although the individual haloes are significantly aspherical,
  galaxy-halo misalignments produce a stacked mass distribution that cannot be distinguished
  from circular. If the lack of alignment found in our simulations is realistic, it
  will be extremely difficult for weak lensing studies to measure the ellipticity
  of cold dark matter haloes using this technique.'
