abstract: We discovered a significant anticorrelation between the mass of a supermassive
  black hole (SMBH), MBH, and the luminosity ratio of infrared to active galactic
  nuclei (AGN) Eddington luminosity, LIR/LEdd, over 4 orders of magnitude for ultraluminous
  infrared galaxies with type 1 Seyfert nuclei (type 1 ULIRGs) and nearby QSOs. This
  anticorrelation (MBH vs. LIR/LEdd) can be interpreted as the anticorrelation between
  the mass of a SMBH and the rate of mass accretion onto a SMBH normalized by the
  AGN Eddington rate, M˙BH/M˙Edd. In other words, the mass accretion rate M˙BH is
  not proportional to that of the central BH mass. Thus, this anticorrelation indicates
  that BH growth is determined by the external mass supply process, and not the AGN
  Eddington-limited mechanism. Moreover, we found an interesting tendency for type
  1 ULIRGs to favor a super-Eddington accretion flow, whereas QSOs tended to show
  a sub-Eddington flow. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that a central SMBH
  grows by changing its mass accretion rate from super-Eddington to sub-Eddington.
  According to a coevolution scenario of ULIRGs and QSOs based on the radiation drag
  process, it has been predicted that a self-gravitating massive torus, whose mass
  is larger than a central BH, exists in the early phase of BH growth (type 1 ULIRG
  phase) but not in the final phase of BH growth (QSO phase). At the same time, if
  one considers the mass accretion rate onto a central SMBH via a turbulent viscosity,
  the anticorrelation (MBH vs. LIR/LEdd) is well explained by the positive correlation
  between the mass accretion rate M˙BH and the mass ratio of a massive torus to a
  SMBH.
