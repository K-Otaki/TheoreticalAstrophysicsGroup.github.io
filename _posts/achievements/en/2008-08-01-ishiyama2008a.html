abstract: Recent high-resolution simulations of the formation of dark-matter halos
  have shown that the distribution of subhalos is scale-free, in the sense that if
  scaled by the velocity dispersion of the parent halo, the subhalo velocity distribution
  functions of galaxy-sized and cluster-sized halos are identical. For cluster-sized
  halos, the simulation results agreed well with the observations. The simulations,
  however, predicted far too many subhalos for galaxy-sized halos. Our galaxy has
  several tens of known dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, simulated dark-matter halos
  contain thousands of subhalos.  We performed a simulation of a single large volume,
  and measured the abundance of subhalos in all massive halos. We found that the variation
  of the subhalo abundance is very large, and those with the largest number of subhalos
  correspond to the simulated halos in previous studies.  The subhalo abundance depends
  strongly on the local density of the background. Halos in high-density regions contain
  a large number of subhalos. Our Galaxy is in the low-density region. For our simulated
  halos in low-density regions, the number of subhalos is within a factor of four
  to that of our Galaxy.  We argue that the ``missing dwarf problem'' is not a real
  problem, but is caused by biased selections of the initial conditions in previous
  studies, which were not appropriate for field galaxies.
