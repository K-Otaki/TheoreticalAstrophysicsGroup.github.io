abstract: 'Aims:We extend the study of two-fluid models of cosmic-ray modified radiative
  shocks by including energy transfer from the cosmic rays to the thermal gas due
  to a cosmic-ray driven acoustic instability. Methods: We perform hydrodynamic simulations
  to find solutions to the time-dependent, one-dimensional two-fluid equations governing
  the thermal fluid and cosmic-ray fluid. Source terms transferring energy between
  the two fluids are included.  Results: The magnitudes of the source terms determine
  the degree to which the cosmic rays modify the radiative shock. We found a range
  of steady solutions characterised by moderate cosmic-ray acceleration and a compression
  ratio significantly greater than 7, which is the limit for cosmic-ray dominated
  shocks. The post-shock temperature and overall compression increase as the source
  term in the thermal fluid''s energy equation increases. For sufficiently strong
  coupling, the solutions are thermally overstable.'
