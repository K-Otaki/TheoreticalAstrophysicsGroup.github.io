abstract: 'We adopted the GPU (graphics processing unit) to accelerate  the large-scale
  finite-difference simulation of seismic wave  propagation. The simulation can benefit
  from the high-memory  bandwidth of GPU because it is a "memory intensive" problem.
  In  a single-GPU case we achieved a performance of about  56 GFlops, which was about
  45-fold faster  than that achieved by a single core of the host central processing
  unit (CPU). We confirmed  that the optimized use of fast shared memory and registers
  were  essential for performance. In the multi-GPU case with three-dimensional  domain
  decomposition, the non-contiguous memory alignment in the  ghost zones was found
  to impose quite long time in data transfer  between GPU and the host node. This
  problem was solved by using  contiguous memory buffers for ghost zones. We achieved
  a performance  of about 2.2 TFlops by using 120 GPUs and 330 GB of  total memory:
  nearly (or more than) 2200 cores of host  CPUs would be required to achieve the
  same performance. The weak  scaling was nearly proportional to the number of GPUs.
  We  therefore conclude that GPU computing for large-scale simulation of seismic  wave
  propagation is a promising approach as a faster simulation is  possible with reduced
  computational resources compared to CPUs.'
