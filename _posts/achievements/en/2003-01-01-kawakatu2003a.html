abstract: 'Based on the radiation hydrodynamic model for black hole (BH) growth and
  incorporating the chemical evolution of the early-type host galaxy, we construct
  the coevolution model of the quasar (QSO) BH and host galaxy. As a result, it is
  found that after a galactic wind epoch, the luminosity is shifted from the host-dominant
  phase to the active galactic nucleus-dominant phase (QSO phase) in the timescale
  of a few 108 yr. The former phase corresponds to the early stage of a growing BH
  and can be regarded as a ``proto-QSO'''' phase. It has observable characteristic
  properties as follows: (1) The broad emission lines are narrower than those of ordinary
  QSOs and are typically less than 1500 km s-1. (2) The BH-to-bulge mass ratio, MBH/Mbulge,
  is in the range of 10-5.3 to 10-3.9. (3) Host galaxies are bluer than QSO hosts,
  by about 0.5 mag in the colors B-V at the rest bands and V-K at the observed bands,
  with assumed galaxy formation redshifts of zf=3-5. (4) The metallicity of gas in
  the galactic nuclei is ~8 Zsolar and that of stars weighted by the host luminosity
  is ~3 Zsolar. (5) The central massive BH (~=107 Msolar) is surrounded by a massive
  dusty disk (>108 Msolar), which may obscure the nucleus in the edge-on view and
  make a type 2 nucleus. By comparing these predictions with recent observations,
  radio galaxies are a possible candidate for proto-QSOs. Also, it is anticipated
  that the proto-QSO phase is preceded by an optically thick phase, which may correspond
  to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). In this phase, MBH/Mbulge is predicted
  to be much less than 10-3 and to grow with metallicity. Moreover, as precursors
  of ULIRGs, optically thin star-forming galaxies are predicted. These may be in the
  assembly phase of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) or Lyalpha emitters.'
