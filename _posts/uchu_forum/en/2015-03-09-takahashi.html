<p>
We use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy (SR-CD) in the vacuum ultraviolet region and  of For chiral amino acid crystals and amino acid precursor molecules to obtain information on the optical activity of the amino acids. From this it is possible to discuss the origin of the asymmetry on earth of biological organic molecules (homo-chirality) from an astrobiology point of view, and to explore the possibility of the detection of chiral molecules with space radio observations.
