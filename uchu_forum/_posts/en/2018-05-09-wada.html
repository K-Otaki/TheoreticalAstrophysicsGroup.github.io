<p>
Textbooks attribute galactic spiral arms to "density waves", but theory suggests that it is difficult induce "stationary density waves in nature". In this presentation, I discuss based on numerical simulations, the physical mechanisms that produce spiral arms, and suggest observational signatures that can be used to differentiate different production mechanisms.
